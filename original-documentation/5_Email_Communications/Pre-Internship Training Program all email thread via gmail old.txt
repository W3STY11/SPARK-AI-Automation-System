Hey guys,

Below is the proposed training program for you to prepare for the internship. Please review and get started at your earliest convenience.

 

Additionally, attached are updated documents detailing the SPARK framework, SAKES repository, and the AI Research & Development Internship program. Changes were required to ensure that the program definition is fully compliant with governmental regulations for unpaid internships, specifically that the program must be wholly focused on training, learning, growth of the interns and not geared toward benefit of Serrala. From my perspective the program is the same but I have defined it more clearly to ensure no confusion about the program objective.

 

Let me know if you have an questions.

 

Best,

Peter

Hey guys,

Here is the second batch of pre-program training courses.

 

There are no costs or only absolute minimal costs associated with doing the actual training, but there is a fee for the optional certification for three of the courses (PL-900, PL-200, and MS Learn:Automate Workflows with Zapier – Approx. $365). I will cover these certification exam expenses, but cannot do so until the internship program has formally started and you have been onboarded to Serrala. For now, I suggest focusing on the training and practicing.

Hey guys,
Below are updated details for the Pre-Internship Advanced Training Plan. After Nick sent me a text saying he could not find the links to the courses, I went back and reviewed with ChatGPT/Grok. It should be clear in the information below that these are not single courses but learning paths that include multiple underlying modules clustered to a topic. Some where misrepresented in the previous version as being available under a specific name, when that name did not really exist and there was some content shown as MS Learn training that is not provided there but rather on OpenAI and Zappier websites.

I have included specific links in the content below that should resolve any clarity issues. 

Sorry for the confusion.

Let me know if you have any questions.

thanks,

Hey guys,

After speaking with Gilles earlier today about his perspective on the courses I proposed in for the pre-program self-training, I am proposing an alternative track. Gilles felt that the courses might be a bit much to consume and absorb without some previous hands-on experience and guidance, which might make it harder to get value out of them for you at this point. For that reason, it may be better to delay doing the first two courses in the second batch until you are in our MS environment.

 

Don’t misunderstand me. If you want to proceed with those courses and it feels productive, please do so. But as an alternative, I propose we accelerate the training courses on ChatGPT, customer GPTs, openAI APIs, and Zappier integration, which you should be in a better position to work on.

 

That being the case, I propose we move forward with training in the 3rd and 4th proposed program in the Advanced training batch and prototyping of non-Microsoft automations/workflows with ChatGPT & Zapier.

 

I also propose you take the following two Coursera courses that also cover these topics, but that also have a foundation of ChatGPT prompt engineering, which you can bypass or accelerate through if it is fully comfortable for you. After that you can proceed with the 3rd and 4th proposed program.

 

1. Common to both Certification Programs - Prompt Engineering for ChatGPT – ~18 hours

2. Common to both Certification Programs - OpenAI GPTs: Creating Your Own Custom AI Assistants – ~7 hours

3. Unique to Program #1 - ChatGPT & Zapier: Agentic AI for Everyone – ~8 hours

4. Unique to Program #2 - ChatGPT: Free AI Tools to Supercharge Productivity – ~8 hours

 

We can discuss on the call.
