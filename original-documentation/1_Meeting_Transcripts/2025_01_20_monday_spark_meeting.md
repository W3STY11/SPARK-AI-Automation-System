Lem   0:04
All good.
How's your weekend?

Bryan Wolf   0:07
Pretty good.

Lem   0:08
That's it's good.

Bryan Wolf   0:12
You.

Lem   0:13
I just stay at home.
Just had some.

Bryan Wolf   0:17
They won't. Did you? As Pete got known with you or no?

Lem   0:20
Pardon.
Come again, right?

Bryan Wolf   0:27
Has has Peter gotten on with you?

Peter Wolf   0:30
I'm wondering now.

Lem   0:30
Not yet.

Bryan Wolf   0:32
OK, OK.

Lem   0:34
Hi, Peter.

Peter Wolf   0:36
Hey.
Yeah. So I just, I I stated this through, I think Thursday this week Friday's a holiday for us limp and then we can restart up.

Lem   0:45
OK.

Peter Wolf   0:49
I'll send the new one starting for next week, but.
Yeah.
All right, so let's I wasn't on the call last whatever Friday.
So let's talk about where we're on the newsletter. I'm I'm making a bunch of revisions.
I'm gonna put a bit different spin on it.

Lem   1:06
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:08
I'm gonna put myself into it.
And and just kind of strategy wise, we'll come to that.
But then I have another flow we can start to work on.
That you can put together.

Lem   1:22
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:24
And yeah, we'll go from there.
OK.
So let's let's look at what we have, what changes were made in the newsletter.

Lem   1:26
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:30
Both.

Lem   1:31
OK, let me.
Open first.
This one.
Uh, share the screen.
OK.
So yeah, this is now the structure for the newsletter. I've also sent this to you guys Friday after the call and then also the Jason file.
So now I've added some two insights to the today's insights.
So I've added like the prompt and also the serrala daily insights and with the new social media and also the AI tools.
And yeah, I've shortened also the like the intro like only one paragraph, 50 words and yeah. So the it's now the blurbs are also shorter like one just one paragraph and then it I've added like the source here.

Peter Wolf   2:22
Yeah.
Yep, Yep, Yep, good.

Lem   2:37
So beside the title and then also fortune and then this is insider.

Peter Wolf   2:37
Got it. Perfect.

Lem   2:44
And then for the social side, this is still the same.
And AI tools productivity still the same.
So this is now also for the prompt.
So yeah, it's actually, it's still the same, just the formatting we would.

Peter Wolf   2:59
OK.

Lem   3:01
Be yeah, add the formatting on the spreadsheet and then for the serrala daily insight.

Peter Wolf   3:01
Yeah.

Lem   3:06
So I've added a placeholder here here like a banner so that it would be grab attention grabbing and then yeah I've added it as like a list.

Peter Wolf   3:11
Yeah.

Lem   3:15
The now it is.
We can add two or three depending on our on how much we want here.

Peter Wolf   3:21
Yep, selection, yeah.

Lem   3:23
Yep, selection and then also here on the upcoming events. It's still the same also like a bullet list with a placeholder photo here like one of your events and then yeah. And then the conclusion.
So what?
What I did in the in the upcoming events is I'm actually just researching and referencing it on your theserrala event, so I'm also using.
The same.
The same like structure from like the.
ChatGPT.
840 I mean oh, oh oh, three.
So this is, yeah, it's still using this one.

Bryan Wolf   4:04
Yeah.

Lem   4:08
So it's researching that link.
So the link is the serral event and then it's extracting it and putting it as an overview here.
So this is like the overview of the event, so Yep.

Peter Wolf   4:21
Yeah, that's that's OK for now.

Lem   4:22
We can all.

Peter Wolf   4:23
It's. I don't.
That's not really gonna work for me because the main companies events aren't the ones that I'm going to be pushing, and plus they do a pretty ****** job of of updating their stuff. So.

Lem   4:24
Yep.
OK, OK.

Peter Wolf   4:37
But this is this is OK for right this minute.

Lem   4:38
Yep. So Yep.
Yeah, this is like the structure just for now.
And then yeah, this is like the IT also has the like the create overview.
So if we put a link here, if we check this one so it will, the other automation will trigger and then it will send an overview here and also like the event title.
So yeah, and then we could just include it to a newsletter here.
So that it will also be processed and then Yep. So I think now we have 123456 actions and then yeah, this is still the same with finalizing and push test push a test and then sending it to our like the list on BR.
So Yep.
So now we already have 88 automations on the system together with like same structure as this as getting an overview of that link for for events.

Peter Wolf   5:36
OK.

Lem   5:39
Yep. So the yeah, the main thing I think here would be like the Ino reader source because.
And yeah, because that's like, I think the structure is already good.
And if you need some adjusting on the like the.

Peter Wolf   6:01
Yeah. Brad, where are we on that?
On the on the Reddit accounts and the LinkedIn accounts, has that all been updated in?

Lem   6:09
Alright, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   6:09
So we update that so so we we we this in this iteration, I think the one that he's showing now Nick and I had already given Lemon implemented the accounts and the HTML format.

Lem   6:12
The.
Yep.
So.
Yeah, the Reddit.
And let me just add, yes, creep system.
So the Reddit and the LinkedIn account.
So I've actually already incorporated it here on the script system.
So we have the this is like the scraping the LinkedIn profile.
So I've changed these profiles to the one Nick gave on the chat.
So these are the ones.

Peter Wolf   6:49
OK.

Lem   6:51
The profiles that post about, like Treasury and finance.
And some AI and then for the filter, because I I didn't add like the 1500 like likes or more because their posts are like very fresh because we're just getting the posts from last week for from these accounts.

Peter Wolf   6:55
Yeah.

Lem   7:10
So the like their engagement is like 10 likes or 20 likes.
So I didn't add the filter and then.

Peter Wolf   7:16
Oh really?
That's how low it is.

Lem   7:18
Yeah, so I've checked this particular because I've what actually what Nick gave is something like this.
So there's no link.
I I'm the one who, like searched them 1 by 1.
On like Google on what their Yep. So this is like just a bunch of list from the. Yeah, this accounts. So I I made sure that I've researched their correct profile and then I've also checked their posts and like some of the posts some of these guys doesn.

Bryan Wolf   7:33
Oh, I know.
Yeah.

Lem   7:53
Post much so they post like once a month. So that's why.
Yeah, I didn't add a filter because.

Peter Wolf   7:58
All right. I think we're gonna have to do.
Did we?
What else did we have?
Did we come in with any or we just use the ones that Nick came up with?

Lem   8:06
Yeah. This is yeah, from Nick.
So this this profiles are from.

Bryan Wolf   8:09
You. Yeah. And nick. And then you also sent whatever ones you sent as well, Pete. Like that Thursday you had sent us.

Lem   8:15
This one.

Peter Wolf   8:21
Alright, I done research and pulled something.
Right from ChatGPT I think.

Bryan Wolf   8:26
So we combined that with what Nikka did too, but yeah.

Lem   8:30
Yep. So yeah, this is actually a pretty long list. I think they're like.

Peter Wolf   8:36
Yeah, but if they're only getting a couple of a couple of responses, whatever, I'm not gonna be posting them. I need.

Lem   8:38
456.

Peter Wolf   8:43
I need something that's much more viral, or, you know, getting getting the the the activity.

Lem   8:44
Yep.

Peter Wolf   8:51
Otherwise, why am I bringing it to their attention?
Is three people looked at the posting.
It's just it may be insightful, but if it's not trending or it's not getting a lot of visibility, then it I don't. I'm gonna include it.

Lem   8:56
Yep.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   9:03
So I need to figure that out.
I need to figure out how.
To get better content there.

Lem   9:06
Yeah.
Yeah. So because last time I've just research it on here, on tap, Leo and the. Yeah. Yeah. And then the LinkedIn one. And they have, like, the viral people there. So.

Peter Wolf   9:14
Right, it's for the LinkedIn, right?

Lem   9:22
And yeah, basically that that guy like I've added three, three guys from their like top ten list and their posts have like some like thousands of thousands of engagement.

Peter Wolf   9:31
Yeah. See, that's what I need. Is something more like that, right?

Lem   9:33
Yeah, yeah. But for for those guys, I think.

Peter Wolf   9:35
Maybe I, maybe I stick with taplio.
I mean with with just with LinkedIn instead of instead of even looking at the Reddit.

Lem   9:39
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   9:46
I just can't be including things that just only have a handful of people in there.

Lem   9:46
Yeah.
No.

Peter Wolf   9:50
It's just why would I be drawn into their attention?
Is the kind of thing right?

Lem   9:54
Yep, Yep, that's right.
So yeah, I think the ones that I've added a while ago was in the past was.
Like the AI guys.
Like the top AI guys from.
The LinkedIn and then.

Peter Wolf   10:10
Yeah.

Lem   10:12
Yeah. So they they're like the top 10.
That's why I think they have like.
They.
They have every post.
They have thousands of likes or like engagements, so.

Peter Wolf   10:24
Yeah. Yep. I think I need to probably focus on that.
We'll leave the other stuff in, but I think I need to focus on that.
We're selecting what we want anyway.

Lem   10:33
Yep, Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   10:34
But I think it's. I got to look at the filters for that and 'cause it's not just AI, right?
I need the slant of the finance part of it.

Lem   10:41
Yep.
I think yeah, basically we this is like if it's already good.
So the like. Our next step here is like to like optimize the content. The content content that it's basically what you really envision, yeah, so.

Peter Wolf   10:54
Yeah.
Yeah, but, but the thing I was doing was having a conversation with Claude and.
Yeah.
I'm trying to strategize on this and what it was emphasizing is I really need to put some personal spin on it.
So I I need to make this.

Lem   11:16
OK.

Peter Wolf   11:18
You know that that introduction is probably gonna be me in my, in my words, right?
Me making the statements. I don't know if I include my image there or something.

Lem   11:23
Yeah. Yeah, this one, yeah.

Peter Wolf   11:28
Probably a small headshot would go over there and then this is, you know, my team, but with me making some strategic commentary about what's going on this week and then somehow peppering that in as we go along too.

Lem   11:38
OK.

Peter Wolf   11:42
But I'm not quite sure.
I don't.
I don't have a vision yet of how how that really how I really do that.
With it not looking weird, I don't know.
I have to.

Lem   11:55
Yeah, we.

Peter Wolf   11:55
I haven't had time to really give it more thought.
But.
It makes sense to me. Then the in reality the it's like if you go down to the articles thing. Yeah, like here when it was emphasizing was, you know, there should be a like a summary or what's what's going on with it but that then it would be.
My kind of spin on why this is important to them, right?
So here we're saying we already have that, but it's really not put as me making that statement or something.

Lem   12:21
Yep, that's right.
Yep, it's just, yeah.

Peter Wolf   12:27
I so that's what I have to think about.
All right.
All right. I I think right now we just put this aside and we keep pushing forward, creating flows and.

Lem   12:35
Mm hmm.

Peter Wolf   12:45
I mean on one side, it's frustrating to me 'cause, I I know I'm kind of creating these and then not bringing them to fruition.
But I've just got a million things on my plate, so I gotta I gotta try and keep us moving forward. The best I can. And then.

Lem   12:58
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   13:04
When I can get the time to be able to focus on the details of adjustment here finalization, that's just do that when I can.
So let's talk about the next low.

Lem   13:16
OK.

Peter Wolf   13:17
And.
Hold on a second.
Alright, so I'm gonna do is a is this research company and we'll start with the non Microsoft environment because that's obviously what we have.
And then once we get into Microsoft Environment, then I'll expand it.

Lem   14:07
OK.
This is.

Peter Wolf   14:09
Gonna be.

Lem   14:12
Microsoft.

Peter Wolf   14:12
Straight.
Yeah. So you know, because we already have this trigger thing with the Gmail, I was thinking, OK, I could start it like that. Ultimately, when I get into Microsoft Environment, what I want is to be able to enter it through teams and to say, hey, here's a request.

Lem   14:19
OK.

Peter Wolf   14:28
In teams and that's the trigger.
But what for now?
This was the other thing.
It was this like I don't really want right now.
We've already said if it's constantly going to Gmail looking that up, that's taken me operations.
And it's unlikely that the majority of the time that I'm gonna have anything there, but I want some way to trigger this thing to be responsive in a timely manner, right? Not to come up an hour later or whatever.

Lem   14:54
OK.

Peter Wolf   14:57
So this is we've talked about this a few times or at least I've brought it up and we've never, I don't think really did it this way, right, with a trigger from some, from a from.

Lem   15:07
Yep.

Peter Wolf   15:10
A.
You know kind of bookmark.
Can we do that?

Lem   15:13
Yeah, we could, we could.

Peter Wolf   15:14
Did we?
I thought we played around with that or thought about that. We ended up not doing it right but.

Lem   15:18
Yeah, because I think for the bookmark it would have like a like a software program, but for the Google firm we could actually do this one like you would just open the Google form and then like enter there a link, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   15:31
Ricky, you are elbow pour.

Peter Wolf   15:33
Yeah, so the Google form would be like the forms we already have where we're saying we put in a little blurb and then we click in and tell it to go trigger to to do the chat, GP summary or something like that, right. OK.

Bryan Wolf   15:35
OK.

Lem   15:40
Yep, that's right. Yeah.
Yep. Like let's say Google, yeah.

Peter Wolf   15:45
So we already have.
Let's do. Let's do that.
Let's make it Google form, right?

Lem   15:48
Yep, Yep.

Peter Wolf   15:49
So then we'll send here.

Lem   15:50
And then you could just send it send, send a link or something for in the Google form and then it will process that.

Peter Wolf   15:51
So take this out.

Lem   16:00
That particular link.

Peter Wolf   16:01
Yeah. So what do you what? I just trying to think, so if we did a Google form because right now in those cases we they're all like putting a URL in, right.
So if we did a URL and said something like.
I don't know. It's just.
DuPont.
Company profile.
Uh.
Yeah.
This feels like I'm going like I'm having to do too much.
I've always just want to to again just put the company name in.
Now it's possible you get something like DuPont and there's different spin offs and all that kind of stuff.
How does it know where to go exactly?
But I also don't want to actually be.
Looking up the company to do it.

Lem   16:58
Yeah, Jake, just the like the name, right?
Name of the like a company or something, yeah.

Peter Wolf   17:04
Yeah, as opposed to a URL, right?

Lem   17:07
Yep, just a name.

Peter Wolf   17:10
So then I let's let's do it that way, right?
It's a it's a Google Google Sheet or Google form.
So manual.
User enters company name in Google.
So I'm using this terminology now, right?
Magentaq process automation.

Lem   17:48
OK.

Peter Wolf   17:49
That's their kind of generically saying so triggered the AP.
I.
Then.
Oops.
So now this isn't necessary, right?
Just extracts the.

Lem   18:22
Yep.
It would just.

Peter Wolf   18:25
Mason Era parses or extracts extracts company name.
I don't really think I would have any other parameters, I just really wanna company name.
I was again.
I was gonna have a document because I feel like documents are easier for us to manage and maintain instead of going in to make and making the changes there.

Lem   18:59
OK.

Peter Wolf   19:03
What are your thoughts on that?
Because we've been doing this in a few different places, and again right now we're using kind of generic ones, but on the persona on the you know on the.

Lem   19:05
Yep.

Peter Wolf   19:14
Yeah. Well, the personal the definition.
What we're looking at, we've we built them to say that we have a supplemental document right in many of those cases.

Lem   19:21
Yep, that's right. Yeah.
Yep. And also like the prompt is also different for like different use cases.
So maybe we could add some like generic prompt when like let's say building the content or.
Because for example like.
The other one is like we're feeding the persona, but it's creating like the overview and then the other one is like creating the like the conclusion something like that.
So there are like.
A little differences on the prompts inside ChatGPT.

Peter Wolf   20:10
Yeah.

Lem   20:10
It it something like that?
Yeah, we could also.

Peter Wolf   20:13
I think that's the way we should go so we can create just a basic one right now say these are the things I want and then we can worry about refining it.

Lem   20:14
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   20:21
But this is what I'm looking to get from that prompt.

Lem   20:22
Yep, yeah.

Peter Wolf   20:24
Right. So let's let's do it though from the beginning with the document so that we're not, you know, spending all putting all that into make. So the make would just say reference this document and let's create a basic document like that with a basic prompt definition of the.

Lem   20:29
OK.
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   20:41
Output expectations.

Lem   20:43
Yep, Yep we could.
Yeah, that that would also be easier.
I think to yeah, we could also use that document to feed like the other automations with that particular prompt.
So yeah, we could also do that one.

Peter Wolf   20:58
OK.
So then what's this optional web data enriching if?

Lem   20:59
By the sign.

Peter Wolf   21:02
More details needed.
Make triggers perplexity. Yeah, so I think this is when I was kind of walking through it, discussing it was like, is this information going to already be available in the in the existing knowledge base or is it going to have to go out and do a a search?
For it, right?

Lem   21:20
Yep.

Peter Wolf   21:21
When you look at things like the.
Kind of banking relationships and treasury operations, I don't.
I mean, often there will be content. There won't be able to find content for this, right?
This is information I'd like to have, but.

Lem   21:33
Pm.

Peter Wolf   21:37
Doesn't necessarily mean I'm going to get it.

Lem   21:40
We could.

Peter Wolf   21:40
When, when the when perplexity does a search, am I?
Am I paying for how much it searches or what it brings back or what we take from it?

Lem   21:49
Yeah. It also also because there's like an input input data, so it also has tokens for that and then like.
How much time it is like spending on the like research or yeah, how much time it is like?
Using the like the server, so there's also that because they they also have like a deep like deep research.
So it yeah, it takes like.

Peter Wolf   22:12
Yeah, but I don't want to do a deep research.
That's maybe too much, right?

Lem   22:16
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   22:17
I mean, I don't.

Lem   22:18
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   22:19
I don't know how do we do. We have any idea what that takes for tokens or what the what the impact of that is?

Lem   22:26
For tokens I think.
Let me just for perplexity 1, right?
OK.

Peter Wolf   22:34
I don't know who.
What do you think would be the best model to utilize?
And then I'd come back.
We, you know, they they typically come back with something like a 20 page form, which means then I would have to take that, feed it to ChatGPT to extract key information.

Lem   22:45
OK.

Peter Wolf   22:48
Which means I'm taking all that data, then I'm reloading it up somewhere else to review it, right?

Lem   22:54
Yeah. So this is like.
A final draft with all of this, it's like.
It's not like an overview, right?
Like it's like a complete document. Yeah, like.

Peter Wolf   23:05
I want to get an executive summary.
I want to be able to say, hey, I'm interested in pursuing this company or I have an opportunity to get on the phone call with them and pitch them something. I want it real quick.

Lem   23:09
A.

Peter Wolf   23:15
Detailed overview of who they are.

Lem   23:15
Yep, yeah.
Yep. And then before.
Yeah, I would.
I would need to also try it to like perplexity.
I think it's much better, but I also also try to use it use chat GT but I think yeah perplexity would be better for this one because yeah, some of this I think would be harder to just search on the Internet.
And.
Yeah, I think.
But for the token costs.
So we have like the the differe research models. So it actually cost for the input and $2.00 per million and output $8. So let's say $10 per million.

Peter Wolf   24:14
Per million tokens you're saying.

Lem   24:14
So.
Yeah, per million tokens. So.

Peter Wolf   24:20
Right. And what if I just again simplify by saying one token equals one word?
It's actually. It's actually less than one word per token.
So it would cost me more, but let's just round up so 1,000,000 words.

Lem   24:30
Yep.

Peter Wolf   24:33
That's a **** load, right? So.

Lem   24:34
Yeah, 1,000,000 words. Yep. Think.
And yeah, but they also have like for example this one like a price per thousand search queries and so 5.
It's well, this is just $5 per thousand search queries.
But yet they also have, like a reasoning tokens.
So this is like the.

Peter Wolf   24:54
Hold on, $5. What?

Lem   24:56
Per 1000 in search queries so.
For this is for the deep research solar sonar, deep research for perplexity.

Peter Wolf   25:01
OK, that's.

Lem   25:09
It's.
Yeah, this is actually good, but I'm not too sure if.
For the like the pricing here, because they have like a detailed report generation expert level subject analysis.
So this is pretty good in like researching like.
In depth.
In depth research.
821415 maybe like $20.

Peter Wolf   25:39
Yeah, maybe I I don't. If I should just narrow this down or.
If I should to to simplify this revenue profitability, keep us.

Lem   25:47
I I could also like test it out.
With this like parameters and then we could actually like check it out the cost of that like run on perplexity.
So yeah, we could.
And then we could estimate if you do this one every day, for example, like for 10 companies.
So we could actually estimate the price for that one, so.

Peter Wolf   26:21
See what happens here.

Lem   26:22
Yeah, this is yeah, vervex defro.
Uh.
This is like the deep research, right? Or just the sonar?

Peter Wolf   26:52
No, I just.
I didn't even do deep research.
I just did a basic.

Lem   26:54
OK.
Yep, just the basic one.

Peter Wolf   26:58
So Dupont's global innovation leader, 70 countries, DuPont, serves electronic water healthcare, 2025 spinning electronics revenue, profitability, net income, EBITDA growth, drivers profitability.
Key products.
Yeah, this is.
This is good right here.

Lem   27:18
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   27:19
Been and all I did was give it those parameters.

Lem   27:20
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   27:23
I didn't even put much more to it, right?

Lem   27:23
Yep.
Yep, I think perplexity is much better on like researching the Internet.
It. Yeah, it analyze it analyzes.
It's better.
Then the ChatGPT 1.
And.

Peter Wolf   27:36
Interesting though, over the weekend when I was playing around with it, I did a search on myself.
I went to the different, you know, platforms to see what it came up with.
This perplexity perplexity said that I was the CEO of Serrala, and said that I had taken over from from Spain when he left.

Lem   27:47
Uh huh.
Oh.

Peter Wolf   27:57
I was surprised really, at how bad it was.
How? How inaccurate it was. The other ones were really pretty accurate, but this one just.

Bryan Wolf   28:01
Well, that's great poster man.

Lem   28:02
Yeah.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   28:06
Totally just.
Yeah, just completely made **** up.

Lem   28:11
It hallucinated some some yes.

Peter Wolf   28:13
Yeah, yeah. Hulu stayed a pretty good picture for me, but but it wasn't the real picture.
Alright, let's let's do this.
Let's let's approach it this way, right?
This looks that looks pretty good.
I'd be happy with this as a report.
They come back to me. I'd be happy with a report like this.

Lem   28:32
Yep.
No, no problem description funds.

Peter Wolf   28:41
You know what?
I'm gonna add one other thing though. Is like latest the latest news articles or something.
What? Something like the top top news?
What? What should I put that as? 'cause like the thing with DuPont is they they're announcing spinoffs all the time, things like that.

Lem   28:54
Like.

Peter Wolf   28:59
So I'm trying to think of something that would give me the the latest news or the latest news.

Lem   28:59
Hmm.
Regarding like the company right or?

Peter Wolf   29:08
Yeah, latest latest financial news or latest organizational structural news or.

Lem   29:14
That that mentions the company like for example the DuPont.
Yeah, I think we could also pull pull that one like a three.

Peter Wolf   29:19
Yeah.

Lem   29:24
Three recent articles or news that mentions that particular company, so Yep.

Peter Wolf   29:41
Include.

Lem   30:59
Device.

Peter Wolf   31:15
You see what it does when I just add this to that.

Lem   31:16
Yep.
Yeah, I think this also has like some citations there.

Peter Wolf   32:00
Yeah, this is good.

Lem   32:01
Citation is, yeah.

Peter Wolf   32:01
This is exactly what I'm looking for, right?
So it gives me information on the most recent financial reporting acquisitions or changes in organizational structure spinoffs. Yeah, so let's, I'll include that. The way it is.

Lem   32:07
And.

Peter Wolf   32:17
That's that's great, right?

Lem   32:17
Yep.

Peter Wolf   32:19
Doesn't have to be perfect, but if there's anything critical going on I should get some visibility with that, right?

Lem   32:24
OK. Yep.

Peter Wolf   32:25
All right. So then.

Lem   32:27
Hmm.

Peter Wolf   32:31
So then we'll take this off.
Don't need this, right?
Says perplexity.
Uh, probably. So Jen and Jeff start.
Yeah, I think this is.
I mean, again, this is just kind of a nice to have thing, but I like it in the process flow.

Lem   32:49
OK.

Peter Wolf   32:52
Poor generation make compile AI generated executive summary.
So I don't know if this already or this is like an extra step to say to convert it to a format.

Lem   33:05
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   33:05
This would already be like we we saw what came back, but it's not and it's structured.
But is it gonna be consistent? I don't know.
Do we need to tell it the structure? I've already said what the categories are and it seems like it gave me a response on each one of those things, right?

Lem   33:12
Yeah, I.

Peter Wolf   33:21
Countries, currencies, banking relationships, trade.

Lem   33:21
Yep.

Peter Wolf   33:23
So it's it's already structured it.
So I think we could probably just take this as it is, right?

Lem   33:30
Yeah, there would be some differences.
Only I think on.
The the.
The output coming from like the API because with this one I think there's some like internal prompting here to like format it good because yeah this is the when we hook it up on the eBay side the reply would be like a different that there's some like differe.

Peter Wolf   33:48
OK.

Lem   33:57
On the like the formatting.
But you could just just use like another, cheaper, cheaper LLM for the form I think.
So that's that's fine. Yep, so it's OK.

Peter Wolf   34:06
So let's do that, right?

Lem   34:08
So yeah, the formatting.

Peter Wolf   34:09
Cheap LLM to do formatting.
OK.

Lem   34:13
The.

Peter Wolf   34:15
So then hold on.
Windows logo.
Yeah.
Use cheaper.
AI.
I don't know 2.

Lem   34:44
Then save the company.

Peter Wolf   34:49
OK.

Lem   34:49
Log into.

Peter Wolf   34:51
So key summary data company log to Google to master Google Sheet for reporting research sequential number tracking.

Lem   34:56
No.

Peter Wolf   35:00
So I think here like I want the Word document or the Google doc right?

Lem   35:01
OK.

Peter Wolf   35:04
We're gonna have a Google doc, but I think we we've already started with the spreadsheet.

Lem   35:05
OK.

Peter Wolf   35:09
We use the spreadsheet to trigger it, so maybe we should just right.

Lem   35:13
Uh.

Peter Wolf   35:14
That's how we said we were gonna start up here.

Lem   35:16
The Google form.
Or yeah.

Peter Wolf   35:18
Yeah. Oh, Google form.
That's not the same thing as Google sheet. What's a?

Lem   35:21
Yep.

Peter Wolf   35:22
What's a Google format exactly?

Lem   35:24
It's like a form that it's connected with, like the e-mail and then the replies are being can receive.

Peter Wolf   35:31
Yeah, but what about? OK.
So I misunderstood when we said that before what?
What about the? Right now we have in the newsletter flow we have spreadsheet and in the spreadsheet we could put in something. We click a button and it triggers make to do its steps.

Lem   35:45
Yep, we could do that.
Yep, the same as. Yeah, like the from Google sheet. Yep, that's right. Yep.

Peter Wolf   35:46
Let's do that right.
So then I'm saying this is Google sheet, right?
User enters company name in Google Sheet.

Lem   35:53
Yep, then it triggers from there and then yeah, it will research. Yeah, basically.

Peter Wolf   35:57
Yeah.
OK.
Yeah, because that this is already kind of a model we're becoming used to, right?
We're doing it in a number of different areas, so we'll create a new workbook specifically for researching companies and we put the name in that. That will then we'll have, we'll have it.

Lem   36:08
Yep, yeah.

Peter Wolf   36:22
Get back some information in there, or just maybe it just says it updated and it gives a URL link to the word doc so that we can come to the Google sheet.

Lem   36:28
Yep, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   36:30
And easily get to it.

Lem   36:31
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   36:32
So put the date, they'll put the URL link.
So let's put this down here.
So key summary data company name.
Doc URL on date.
I don't need this other stuff.
Company name dot URL, date and what? Anything else?
Log to master Google Sheet for reporting, research or for.

Lem   37:09
Yeah.
I would just add there are like Colum also for like process in the last one yeah for the.

Peter Wolf   37:16
Yeah.

Lem   37:19
Yeah.
Process.
Mm.
And we would need to put a tracking number also, Sir. Yeah, that's fine.
Sequenced is trying number.
So that it's like a unique identifier, right?
Unique identifier for the.
View ID OK.
Delivery PDF for docking center restaur Gmail.

Peter Wolf   37:56
So the PDF or DOC Link sent to request a via e-mail, but this we didn't do this with the e-mail trigger, right?

Lem   38:01
Yep, yeah.

Peter Wolf   38:05
But we could do this just based on a predefined set of e-mail addresses.

Lem   38:11
Yep, that's right.
Yeah, we we could just.

Peter Wolf   38:12
So.

Lem   38:13
Yeah, after like at the last part, it will also send like the report or like the Google Doc with the e-mail with the like attachment of the Google Doc link to to the Google Doc to that particular e-mail for the delivery.

Peter Wolf   38:15
Let's.
Yeah.
OK, so create.
A e-mail with.
Google doc attachment.
And deliver.
To.
Find list.
E-mail.
Accounts.
OK.

Lem   39:00
OK.

Peter Wolf   39:01
So then this other stuff down here, this is what would happen if I when I push it into Microsoft, you see here like add Salesforce and Salesloft integration.

Lem   39:02
The.
OK.

Peter Wolf   39:11
And I want to trigger from actually from like.
A trigger trigger from either chatbot or from optional trigger from Google Chat no from.
Ms. teams.
Or other chat bot.
OK.

Lem   39:33
OK.

Peter Wolf   39:34
So we don't need to worry about this right now.
We're just focused on this stuff up top.

Lem   39:36
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   39:44
All right.

Lem   39:45
OK, copy.

Peter Wolf   39:46
So I'll send this to you guys.

Lem   39:46
Got it.

Peter Wolf   39:50
Now just to make sure.
OK.

Lem   40:39
OK.
Well, let me just check my Yep.
OK.
Got it.

Peter Wolf   40:50
All right.

Lem   40:52
Uh.

Peter Wolf   40:53
Right. You have stuff to work on with Lynn.

Bryan Wolf   40:57
I mean other than improving the flow from last week, which I think I can, we can talk about what he did. But I think it's pretty much exactly where his is almost.
And then he's gonna improve on whatever we said today.
And then I could really get into this flow or if I wanted to stay on or I don't know.

Peter Wolf   41:21
Well, what I'd like you to do is is.
I mean, even if you're just watching when Lem's working on this, I think engaging with him and and seeing this stuff being done is helpful as opposed to, you know, as opposed to not. So I would utilize the time with him even if it's just walking through.

Bryan Wolf   41:37
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   41:39
The the process flow that that we just defined, OK.

Bryan Wolf   41:43
OK.
Yeah, that's fine.

Lem   41:44
OK.
No problem.

Peter Wolf   41:45
All right, great.
I'll talk to you guys later. Bye.

Lem   41:49
OK, Peter.
OK.
Let's let me just open the.

Bryan Wolf   42:03
Peter, are you still here?
Pete Junior, are you staying in?

Peter Wolf Jr   42:07
Stand in.
Yeah, I'm about to get out.

Bryan Wolf   42:10
OK.

Peter Wolf Jr   42:11
In like the next couple minutes.
Are you at your house or you at Big Pete's? No, I'm around.

Lem   42:17
Sharon.

Bryan Wolf   42:20
No, I'm. I'm arriving at Pete's in like 3 minutes. 2 minutes.
I'm right around the corner.

Peter Wolf Jr   42:27
3 minutes, 2 minutes. All right case.

Lem   42:33
OK.
Let's try it again.
OK.
So let's create.
First, the new spreadsheet.
Uh, let's name this uh.
Search.
Company system.
Uh.
Yeah. So this would be like.
Yeah. Basically we will have the same trigger.
So you would have the company name here.

Bryan Wolf   43:21
Wait, what's this for? Is this?
Hold on. Hold on.
For.

Lem   43:26
Yeah, this is for the this one the new flow.

Bryan Wolf   43:30
OK.
Great. OK.
Yeah. So, OK, I'm. I'm with. Hold on lem.

Lem   43:31
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   43:33
I'm like 2 minutes away from my actual laptop but.

Lem   43:37
OK.

Bryan Wolf   43:39
You're you're, you're.
Sorry, you're to the laprador so.
Our newsletter flow is like the exact same, so we don't even what for what I missed like the first part of the call where you showed him whatever. Did you work on that like Friday, Saturday, Sunday?

Lem   43:57
The newsletter flow.

Bryan Wolf   44:00
Yeah, the the LinkedIn posting or the newsletter 1.

Lem   44:01
No. Yeah.
Yeah, it's still the same as like the last time we meeting. Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   44:06
OK, great. Great, great, great.
That's what I thought.
That's what I thought. I just wanted to make sure.

Lem   44:09
So I haven't.

Bryan Wolf   44:10
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

Lem   44:12
Yeah, yeah. Haven't updated yet, so.
You you successfully connected. Alright, the for the the new.

Bryan Wolf   44:21
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was the exact I work.

Lem   44:23
Yeah, the sorry.

Bryan Wolf   44:24
I remember we just had a.
We had a discrepancy with like the Google Sheets almost getting overloaded I think.
Or whatever.

Lem   44:31
Yeah. For the. Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   44:32
It needed a break to it then I had.

Lem   44:36
We're having the yeah APR rate limit for that one.
Uh.
Yeah. So I'm I think you only need.
To figure the APA.
Uh.
OK, need a fields.
Hmm.
OK, company name.
Google doc link.
Date processed.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   45:47
So are you doing it?
'Cause, we're switching from Google form and using Google sheet instead or.

Lem   45:52
No, we we will be using now again just the Google sheet because yeah, Peter thought that this.

Bryan Wolf   45:57
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   45:59
Yeah, we already using this like design we're triggering from here, so yeah.

Bryan Wolf   46:00
Right, right, right, right.

Lem   46:05
You'll still be using basically the same trigger.
I'm just a trucking number.
Yeah, so I was.
Then.
Dropping number UID.
Umm so inside left.
Start research.
Then just add.
The.
Forgot the form.
I think it's the format.
Switches.
Alright, the check box.
And then.
Yep, so.
OK.
So I think we're.
It's just create another one.
That's basically, we're still gonna use a web book for this one.
And then.
Search system book.
OK.
And then 1st is to pull out.
Pull out the.
Actually.
Uh.
Yeah. Let me just think we're it's easier if we will just.
Clone this one.
And then.

Bryan Wolf   48:30
OK.

Lem   48:35
Uh research.
System.
Search company.
Company.
MMM.
Then we're gonna add it slightly.
Yeah, so web book and then search tools.

Bryan Wolf   49:09
I have this one right.

Lem   49:09
Hmm.

Bryan Wolf   49:10
I do.
I do have this one.

Lem   49:12
The Yeah, basically I'm just.
I cloned it and then because I like the flow, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   49:17
Yeah. I just wanted to make sure it's all right.
You did that too.

Lem   49:19
Just add.
The.
Some.
Can't find.
The.
Let's try.
It's user system.
It's.
This one.
No.
I think didn't still. Oh, let me just change.
Research.
Right. This is the on the folder.
So.
Hmm.
Yeah, I think.
Search.
Yeah.
Company name.
Yeah, this is the right one.
So, uh, start research through.
Then start to.
Call to.
Uh. Processed.
OK.
So yeah, so now basically this would catch the oh ****.
Why did it didn't save?
I think it's having a hard time getting the.
Just put this one outside.
OK.
Uh.
It's not picking it up.

Bryan Wolf   52:36
Oh.
It's been crapped in my.

Lem   52:54
Search through status QUOT processed K.
And now we're gonna change this to.
Oh ****.
Oh.
What happened?
Reached out again.
OK.
I have perplexed dear.
Solar did research.
Let's try first on there bro.
Contangent system.
Uh.
So let's say.
Say it again, do Pont.
It's two point 2.0.
Yeah, DuPont.

Bryan Wolf   55:08
So.

Lem   55:20
Still point.
Yep. And then.
OK.
So we got.
Task.
Alright, so this should come from Google Docker.
Uh.
So need to create a.
Uh.
Google Talk get content.
Then.
I think we only need an iterator.
Document ID.
Yeah. So you would need.
Umm.
The prompt would be here.
And just test it out first.
Research.
Hmm.
OK.
Your task is to.
Search.
Company provided the.
Structured summer according to the sections.
Uh.
These sections.
Hmm.
Conference.
Let's just run.
Overview.
Make a summary.
Yeah, I'm not sure if we can do this one.
It's just trying to just reserve.
Company to research.
All right.
OK.
Dynamic prompt.
Then.
Uh.
Create a document search.
And go drive.
The search.
Alright, I need to add the scope.
****.
Alright, do this.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:24
Sorry.

Lem   1:00:27
Yeah, so I need.
The.
Could open the all right.
You could just list the documents.
OK, this this works.
Oh.
Let's get.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:58
Oh, I said, soft in the.

Lem   1:01:06
Ation ID.
Documentary this song.
OK.
That's good.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:39
Play easier like that.
Stop.
Sorry.

Lem   1:01:50
Text content.
Then add here the.
****.
Oh crap.
Didn't save that one.
Hmm.
OK.
I think I.
Company.
OK.
You're output should be.
Let's try it first.
Choices.
Hmm.
Yeah, it's different.
Hmm.
It's really having different on.
There.
Review revenue.
Sugar plants.
Yeah, that's odd. It's different.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:24
What do you mean? For all the content you get output right here on May 1st.

Lem   1:06:27
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:28
The one that's actually in the actual like website.

Lem   1:06:30
OK.
Yeah, that's right.
It's actually as you can see, there's like the years and like Q1Q3 here like with all the parameter like.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:39
Yeah. Take out the valuable. Yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:06:42
You have here.
It's like it's just an.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:44
That doesn't translate.

Lem   1:06:45
Yeah, it's just an overview, so.
I think.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:49
I wonder why?

Lem   1:06:51
Yeah, and the prompt is basically I just copy pasted the prompt.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:53
Maybe because the format, yeah.

Lem   1:06:56
Yeah, the The thing is on like this particular perplexity, right?
This is like the consumer side. So they've actually embedded some prompts here.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:03
OK.

Lem   1:07:06
That's why it's outputting like it's like a user friendly.
Like.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:12
What do you mean by embedded?

Lem   1:07:14
Like there's.
The there's we're like adding a prompt here, like for example this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:18
In those sections, yeah.

Lem   1:07:20
Yeah, but they actually have like a system prompt here also. That is that we can't see. That's why it's like spitting out different differently. And here it's just a raw prompt. Like it's just our, like, prompt our raw prompt.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:30
OK.

Lem   1:07:37
That's why there's like, yeah, yeah. There's like, a difference because this is just.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:37
I got you insane, yeah.
And it's just ****.
It's just pushing it out.

Lem   1:07:42
Yeah. And then here? Yeah, because basically this is like a user interface already the for, yeah, for the consumer side.
So it's like a user friendly output so I think.
Yeah, maybe we just add the rules or.
Rather, rules or something.
No, I think I'm gonna copy and paste here first.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:13
The one I gave you.

Lem   1:08:14
Yeah, dynamic prompt, but because.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:16
OK. And this is what?

Lem   1:08:18
Yeah, it's it's much.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:19
This is what this is from Peter, right?
That's what this thing right here, yeah.

Lem   1:08:21
Yeah, this is from Peter, but yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:24
Yeah.
Sure.

Lem   1:08:26
And.
I see.
It's much easier to test it out here if.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:31
Yeah.

Lem   1:08:32
Copy paste then just add the name here.
So basically my goal is to like.
Output like the same.
The same output as this one because this is actually very good.
It's like a short, but it has like the. Yeah, like this one.
It has the revenue with all the citations.
So yeah, this like a citation. Also for that one.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:53
Well.

Lem   1:08:57
So this is actually good.
So I think I'm not sure if it's on the prompt side.
Structures are.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:12
I wonder if you could put like another perplexity step.
Would that help?
Or no, just to specifically get that individual data we're missing.

Lem   1:09:17
Umm.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:20
Maybe it's just a?

Lem   1:09:23
Individually, yeah, we could also. Yeah. But it would be like.
Like, because how much is like 10 more than 10.
Data points, so I think it would be a good.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:39
No, sorry about it.

Lem   1:09:42
Yeah, it would be like.
And then I think it would cost also much more.
Compared to the like.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:52
That's true just.
1.
What?

Lem   1:09:59
Yes, I think it's because of the.
Let me just change this one.
I.
AM.
So learn some business can just write a currency series.
Corporate structure.
To the link.
Then.
Recovery this one.
So actually the like the structure here. I mean other parts here are like pretty straightforward.
This I think this one will be this.
This one would also take time because we need to like scrape the Internet for their logo.
But the other parts here are actually like.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:17
Uh huh.

Lem   1:11:20
Very easy to incorporate. We just add like the yeah, the Google Mail and stuff.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:23
Awesome.

Lem   1:11:26
So yeah, the the main thing here would be like the prompt. The output for this one and also the logo, so that would.
Be like the.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:36
'Cause. That's what this that's what you're trying to get.

Lem   1:11:36
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:38
This is what we will you send me that he looks? I don't know if Peter said that.

Lem   1:11:39
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:43
Can you share that Google Doc with me?

Lem   1:11:44
This one.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:45
The long are you saying? Yeah.

Lem   1:11:46
Yep.
Sure, I think.
I'm not sure if you send this or I think it's. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think you send this to all of us.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:50
I'm if I'm no, I'm on there. I'm on there.
I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nice, yeah.

Lem   1:11:57
And yeah, basically what I did here is I just cloned the first one.
But actually we could build it from scratch and then just add the search row here.
So this is actually web web hook.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:07
So I just, yeah.

Lem   1:12:10
Yeah, the web hook and then the search row and then so the web book is just for triggering whenever we like click the.
Click the here this one.
So this will trigger right?

Bryan Wolf   1:12:23
OK.

Lem   1:12:23
And then it would search for this particular row, the one that has like the check mark and then the date the status is empty.
It's not processed, so it will find that one and then.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:33
OK.

Lem   1:12:39
Yeah, and then it will search for. It will pick that up and then it will get the prompt from this Google Doc.
So yeah, this is like a new design that that Peter wanted.
So we we would put the prompt here on the Google Docs.
So that I could be like easily edited in the future. So or like copy pasted to other people if they want to.
So yeah, and then you will just feed that to perplexity.
So I'm just for now I'm just testing it so I'm just like hard coding it for now. Like the prompt here, just to edit it and then if it's all good I will just copy it, paste it to the document.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:18
OK.

Lem   1:13:18
So yeah.
Let's check.
The.
Yes, it's still feeding.
It's still outputting like.
Umm.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:36
Does the rest of it OK though?

Lem   1:13:36
Yeah, it's.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:37
Or is it just that one little?

Lem   1:13:40
Yeah, this should be like it should like bullet list.
Maybe I would.
Yeah, I need to add some.
Need to edit the prompt engineering for this one like.
Really good.
2-3 years.
And will it rest?
Oh.
Yeah. So this one is actually.
Oh, this is all bullet list.
So that's yeah, I think.
Hmm.
Make it in a bullet list.
Complete. Uh.
Complete.
And also this doesn't have excitations.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:58
OK.
You say compared to the the the other one from the like the actual browser.

Lem   1:15:07
Yep, that's right.
Yeah. As you can see, there's no like a citations here.
So yeah, the main yeah, there's no. Let me just see.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:12
Yeah.

Lem   1:15:18
Yeah, there's. Oh, there's actually some citations, but.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:20
Oh yeah, it's good.

Lem   1:15:23
How did this error based on the size of the video one for example summarizes like this? Yeah, it's.
It has citations which is found here.
This is the citations.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:34
OK.

Lem   1:15:35
Yeah. So this like one.
Four. Yeah. No #1, #4, #7.
So those are the citations.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:42
Yeah.

Lem   1:15:44
So yeah, it's actually there.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:45
Mm hmm.

Lem   1:15:47
It's just that, yeah, the I think.
Yeah, it has some.
We just need to adjust a little bit the prompt for this one because this doesn't have.
It's not comprehensive enough and.
With the data and all.
Yeah, but for this one we have also the.
News. So it's good.
It actually outputed the news five most recent articles, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:16
Yeah, it's not all bad.
It's not.
It's not all bad. It's just that once missing that little section, there is clipping some information.

Lem   1:16:21
Yeah.
Yep. And then we could just feed this one to like a cheap.
Hey, I'm chief chachi. Piti.
Like ChatGPT 40 mini.
So it's a very cheap like I think.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:34
Like in make like we would we would transition, right, right.

Lem   1:16:37
Yeah, for the for the formatting, because if we output this one on the Google Docs it would like yeah, it would be ugly and it would just look like this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:46
So will chat GT be able to like almost reference that link too or that that's where reaching group X sleep first, so that maybe if we switch it to GBT I can pick up the missing data that's just all in the prompt we have to update the prom.

Lem   1:16:59
What we could? What do you mean? We will change this to ChatGPT or.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:05
Like next?
Yeah, like when we're transitioning into the next the next like node.

Lem   1:17:11
Yep, we will send this data and then yeah, we will actually send the data and then just the other ChatGPT will just format it.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:13
Like.

Lem   1:17:22
To like.
Like a good formatting for the Google like the Google Doc so that it would, yeah, it would look good.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:28
Yeah.
Output better will show.

Lem   1:17:31
Yeah, output output the IT better on the Google Doc, so I think we, yeah we would do like markdown format for that with all the bullet points and stuff. But yeah, so.
Let me just test this again so.
And then.
I've I'm so I'm also thinking for like the image one.
Like I'm also thinking if like we would, we would use.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:04
Cash again or up up.

Lem   1:18:06
I know because it should be like the logo for that particular company.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:10
The graph, right? Yeah.

Lem   1:18:10
So yeah, so I would check out that graph or like we could maybe use.
Like.
Amplify or?
Like just Google their Google like Google API and then like.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:28
Mm hmm.

Lem   1:18:29
Or something. So I yeah, I would need to check that out. How to script the logo.
So.
Yeah, I think this is much better.
So it has.
Oh, it's just that it's already.
Like.
Too much summarized.
Net sales.
And then for operating EBITDA EBITDA?

Bryan Wolf   1:18:58
Isn't that what we were looking?
Isn't that what?
I don't know it is.

Lem   1:19:01
All right.
Yeah. So it's actually, yeah, it's the same as.
Yep, actually it's the same with.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:08
So it's just further down.
Where was that?

Lem   1:19:13
02024 This one this is actually this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:21
It's still kind of laid out differently, though.
It's missing some stuff still right here.

Lem   1:19:24
Yeah.
Yeah, because this one it's like has the queue, the quarter quart, the queue, this is queue 3 from queue 3.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:30
Yeah.

Lem   1:19:34
Yeah. And this is from like just 2023-2024.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:40
Yeah.

Lem   1:19:43
MMM.
Then keep products.
And to business.
That's already showing.
Currency used.
Yes, it's actually outputted it all us like a bullet form list.
Uh.
Yeah, I think it's because of this.

Bryan Wolf   1:20:13
Do you have another format that you like more that could work?

Lem   1:20:16
Umm.
Yeah, we need to like.
Optimize it a little bit.
Well, it's actually already.
Yeah. For this one, it's.
Quite it's quite confusing because it's not the same as this one.
MMM.
List of fears.
It would be good if we could like see the.
Uh.
Yep.
Hmm.
Check if I would just change it to.
Every every good.
From last two to three years with.
All the complete data.
All the complete.
So yeah, basically I just test this one, yeah, then iterate test, iterate test and then just this module until.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:43
See what it changes.

Lem   1:21:45
You have it changes in the up until we could.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:46
The cast and check out those.

Lem   1:21:48
We could get like a pretty decent.
Yeah, pretty decent.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:55
So now when you're testing this though, it's it's still like it's still, yeah.

Lem   1:21:56
Output.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:01
It's it's like charging unresolved.

Lem   1:22:02
Yeah.
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:05
But it's a free version actually, so it doesn't matter, right?

Lem   1:22:06
The the This this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:11
Yeah, when you're running like that, when you're chessing like that, does it charge you still? Like, if I plug in my URL, my API key? Whichever. Right now, I'll do that too.

Lem   1:22:12
No.
Yeah, it.
Yeah, it.
Yeah, it actually charges because.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:22
Every time.

Lem   1:22:23
Yeah, every time.
So this one is the free version because I'm not signed in here.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:25
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem   1:22:28
So yeah, this is, but this particular when you connect to like the API. So every time you connect to an API, you're actually spending tokens for like perplexity, ChatGPT.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:36
Mm hmm.

Lem   1:22:39
But they're actually like other llms.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:40
I wonder if if if like, I'm sorry, let me cut you off, but I wonder if if I connected my actual thing, if we catch that data that's missing.

Lem   1:22:45
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:51
Does that even matter?
You know how.
It's how it's like misformating that.

Lem   1:22:56
This one like the the.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:58
Yeah. So just based off that like since that's not connected to like the actual API token or like, how do you have yours firing?
You just have yours in there.

Lem   1:23:08
Oh, yeah, yeah, my, my. Yeah. This one, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:08
Like at the very beginning. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that part I'm talking about that. OK.

Lem   1:23:11
So it's actually added. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The connection.
Yep. So it's actually connected to the.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:16
OK.

Lem   1:23:17
Yeah, I think this is pretty good actually.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:20
It is I. I think so too.

Lem   1:23:21
This. Yeah, it's it's not.
Oh, I think we need to also include like the quarterly.
Yeah, but it's actually much better.
Like it's near here.
Not explicitly stated here the one primary use SAP as its enterprise user planning or platform own knowledge.
Yeah, for so for the citations, I think we would need to.
Add the citations here.
Also so headline.
And then in date I'm sorry headline date summary.
Let me just.
And grow from rest of year two years.
Sample quarterly.
Q3.
Very, very good lessons.
Yeah, it's a change.
Check it again if it's.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:12
Could you send me this?

Lem   1:25:14
The.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:15
Prompts.

Lem   1:25:17
The prompt from.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:20
Your perplexity.

Lem   1:25:21
With the.
Anoop.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:23
But you just right there.
Yeah. Yeah, that's no, no, no. On the on the actual URL side.

Lem   1:25:27
You are.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:29
Like, go back, go back, go back, go back to.

Lem   1:25:31
This one.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:32
Yeah, that. Yeah, all everything there.
Like the prompts you put in for the first one to get this data output.

Lem   1:25:38
Oh yeah, the prompt is actually here on the file.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:42
Just word for word. That's what you you just put that in. OK. Alright.

Lem   1:25:43
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah. So I just added this one and yeah, I've just copy pasted copy pasted this one actually.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:51
Right, right, right.

Lem   1:25:53
Yeah.
Then yeah, we could play around with this one.
Like, write a comprehensive and not just an executive, not a summary.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:00
Right. OK.

Lem   1:26:00
Structured compensation.
So yeah, we I think we could.
Yeah, so now it's spitting out like a table.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:17
Yeah.

Lem   1:26:17
So this is.
This is.
And as you can see, we could also try ChatGPT, but not sure if.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:39
You would do that.
What do you mean?
Try it like same way perplexity.

Lem   1:26:43
Yeah, like.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:44
So why?
Why use perplexity first?
Why? What about Claude? If I clawed to be, like almost the best one?

Lem   1:26:49
Uh.
I'm not sure.
Yeah, I think we could also use.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:55
OK anthropic.

Lem   1:26:56
Yeah, Claude for the output.
Yes, I'm just checking out if.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:03
I mean, whatever works.

Lem   1:27:07
Yeah, I think we could.
We could also use.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:11
04 million.

Lem   1:27:13
The.
No GPT 04.
It's much better.
The just for testing.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:24
OK.

Lem   1:27:27
On GTA.
OK.
Then let's yeah, we could also try Claude actually, but I'm not sure if my cloud is here.
But.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:48
Hold on.

Lem   1:27:49
The yeah. So, because they're they're like updating it every day, right?
The the LLM.
So actually we, but in the past perplexity is like really good in the researching side.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:07
Hello.

Lem   1:28:07
But yeah, right now I'm not too sure if maybe Claude is has some.
Yeah, maybe Claud is better already.
Let's just try this for.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:21
Maybe I can play around with it later.

Lem   1:28:23
Yep, I am in. What's this, Eminem.
Merge in this merge in acquisition, right? Yeah, M and a.
Umm.
And they.
Oh.
Yeah, I think we could also you could also try because yeah, you have the like the prompt, right?
This is just the prompt I didn't change yet on the document.
And then, yeah, maybe Claude will have a good much better output.
So let's just try also.
If catch you could you would.
Because the one I used also on the yeah on the like the newsletter process flow was just ChatGPT.

Bryan Wolf   1:29:20
Oh God.
Sorry.

Lem   1:29:29
I didn't use perplexity for that one.
Uh.
Uh.
Oops.
Oh, it's empty.
It's odd.
Yeah, I think it didn't.
Didn't research any anything, huh?
Alright.
Or does the research?
Company provided.
Here we finish.
Internet.
Alright.
I don't know.
Structured.
Yeah, the IT would be.
I think this one and then like webhook, Google sheet, Google Docs and then we'll have this researching right.
And then next is.
Like the scraping for the logo and then.
Will put that one in the Google Doc and then add it to the spreadsheet and then e-mail.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:58
So scrape it, just scrape it.

Lem   1:32:01
Yeah, we we would need to.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:02
That's just like putting one thing in there, right?
Mainly like if we put Unsplash in there or I remember you said something different. 'cause. It's like a different time.

Lem   1:32:05
Uh.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think it would be different because it would.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:13
Right.

Lem   1:32:14
You would need to scrape for the logo and then like get that logo.
So I think that would be like some processes there like there's a Download file and some like HTTP request also.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:20
OK.

Lem   1:32:24
But yeah, basically that would be.
For the logo, but.
Yes, as you can see it actually can't.
Yeah, it can't.
Research the.
Yeah, the company.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:50
To actually be to care.

Lem   1:32:52
Yeah.
Can't research the.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:56
Wait, why? It just finished?

Lem   1:32:58
Not sure.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:58
There's nothing in the output.

Lem   1:33:00
Is.
I can use the.
So I think I was using.
For O search I think.
Everything was for for a search here.
It's not all three.
Uh.
Yep, so now it actually.
Reversing it says refuse to do it again.
It says reinstate the. Yeah, it's this is actually good.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:00
But you do like this.

Lem   1:34:02
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:02
OK.

Lem   1:34:06
Maybe I wanna keep that series as.
Try next.
And so business.
Umm.
Yes. So for this one, I think it's, uh, the same with the perplexity, but yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:22
Perplexity.

Lem   1:34:26
Yeah, this is actually good recent articles.
Yeah, it's actually good.
Yep, point reported net sales of.
This was the one that I am like. Yeah, perplexity's having a hard time for this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:47
Oh wow, it still looks stupid.

Lem   1:34:52
Yeah, 2022-2023.
And then there's like a very this one is very recent, right?
P 1/20/25.
And then there's also like.
Yeah, like a sighting here.
Like a citation.
So let's check this out.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:08
Mr. Raj.

Lem   1:35:10
If, if it's not hallucinating so sometimes.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:10
Yeah, that they.
This just puts it in there.

Lem   1:35:15
Yeah, it just puts and then, yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:16
See, So what is this?
This is the actual citation that you're going for the for measurement.

Lem   1:35:21
Yep, for the this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:24
So, and that's what this this martini like that.

Lem   1:35:26
Yep, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:27
Yeah, that's OK.

Lem   1:35:28
So this is actually also coming from like an AI think.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:32
I was gonna say, do you know what this is?

Lem   1:35:34
No, no, no, no. Because I I just checked like this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:35
No. OK.
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:35:40
Yeah, this is like.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:42
But So what is this article? This is what it is, I guess, yeah.

Lem   1:35:46
Oh no, I think this is like.
Aai for checking company like the one that I we're building so.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:53
Yeah. And they just have DuPont on here.

Lem   1:35:56
Yeah. So it's executive summary.
So yeah, this is actually the one that we are, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:59
Huh.
Reading so it's not even a surreal citation.

Lem   1:36:05
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:07
Or I guess it's depending on how good this this is, right?

Lem   1:36:09
I I think it research.
Yeah, it research the company, but it just outputs like simple because like like a sample format I think.
But there's actually a download.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:21
I was just see download report, yeah.

Lem   1:36:23
Yeah, so it.
Yeah, basically it just I think it just searched here like a DuPont and then it output this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:28
Yeah.
Peter.

Lem   1:36:31
Yeah. And then, Yep, company background, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:33
What's below it? That's yeah.

Lem   1:36:36
So yeah, this is actually pretty comprehensive.
So ChatGPT went in the Internet action, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:40
It is.
It doesn't cover answer.

Lem   1:36:43
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:43
Is that it though is.
Oh, no. There's more, yeah.

Lem   1:36:45
Yeah. So.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:48
That's it, stocks.

Lem   1:36:49
Yep.
This report, so I think this is also like, yeah, another platform.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:53
Credit risk report.

Lem   1:36:56
So it was.
It was able to.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:00
He looks great.
That looks this looks good.

Lem   1:37:02
Yeah.
Martini AI.
Yeah. So the I haven't.
Yeah, I wasn't able to also.
Like, yeah, this is my first time I think to it's actually good also.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:17
Hello.
I wonder, do you think that to make? Probably not.

Lem   1:37:21
Yeah, yeah.
We can actually, if we they have like an API so.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:28
Like is what?
Does that even make sense what I said or no?

Lem   1:37:32
Yeah, actually.
So because.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:33
OK, OK.

Lem   1:37:35
Rather than like searching the Internet right, we could just connect here and then it will create the executive summary, because I think this is their particular product.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:37
Yeah.
Let me show.

Lem   1:37:46
There are, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:48
It's not only.

Lem   1:37:50
Like a corporate research assistant.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:52
Yeah.

Lem   1:37:53
So not sure if.
Tini dot AI.
Or I think they.
Let's check if they have.
Moderate.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:06
You said me that.

Lem   1:38:08
Martini. Oh, they don't have.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:10
It's not on there. It's not on there. I just looked.

Lem   1:38:11
Yep, it's not on it, but.
Hmm.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:17
How did you find that account?
I can't even see on Google.

Lem   1:38:21
I just found it also here. So chat chat, yeah chat, chat, chat. Gv also cited.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:24
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
I.

Lem   1:38:27
I have the citation.
Yeah. Yeah, it's actually, yeah, this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:29
Decided it, yeah.
Yeah.

Lem   1:38:33
So it actually cited other AI for its research.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:35
Can you put that in chat for me?

Lem   1:38:36
So yeah, that's crazy.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:37
Like really quick.
Could you put that in chat?

Lem   1:38:40
The martini.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:41
Yeah, no, the the HD right there, right there.

Lem   1:38:42
This. This one. Yeah. Yeah. OK. OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:44
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:38:46
It's actually.
It's pretty funny, actually.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:54
That is. Yeah, that is funny.

Lem   1:38:55
Are you seeing another AI? Ah.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:57
I know, yeah.
But it's good, though it's comprehensive.

Lem   1:39:01
Yeah, it's good. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:01
It's really good.

Lem   1:39:04
Alright. Yeah, we could actually search here.
They don't have.
I think they don't have.
Yeah, they don't have like an open.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:13
Yeah, maybe it's just very couple things specific, but.

Lem   1:39:13
API, yeah.
Yeah. So they don't have API endpoint.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:17
That one.
Specific one's good.

Lem   1:39:22
But yeah, I think this is if they have, that would be really helpful.
We could just say.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:27
Yeah.

Lem   1:39:30
Create.
And.
What's that again?
Research could actually copy the prompt here and.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:34
Tupont.
Yeah.

Lem   1:39:39
Let's see if what it yeah, but we could.
We couldn't connect.
I I I am just curious on the.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:44
Yeah, me too. Me too.
Me too. I'm down.

Lem   1:39:46
Yeah, the output of their AI.
So let's check it out.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:00
I would do deep.

Lem   1:40:00
It's just a fast, deeper. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:01
Yeah, you're gonna try.
What do you wanna do?

Lem   1:40:05
Let's try deep.
I think we could, yeah. Check the deep deep one.
Because this is actually like free, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:40:12
Yeah.

Lem   1:40:13
So the only thing here I think is this would like take much time. I think if the like with the yeah, take a long time with the deep research same as on chat GP ChatGPT they have.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:18
Take a long time, really.
Yeah.

Lem   1:40:25
Deep research and yeah, and also perplexity so.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:26
Deep research feature too.
I'm looking at these graphs.

Lem   1:40:33
Yeah, this is really good.
Probability of default.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:35
This is last month.
This is taken directly from its stocks.
Is this what?
This is it says down from last month end spread.

Lem   1:40:39
Yeah, I think so.
Like the spread, it's like the company RIS momentum.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:44
Company risk momentum.

Lem   1:40:47
Stick for yeah, rating A1 chemical side coverage.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:49
I feel like that's good information right now, chemicals like her.

Lem   1:40:56
Yeah, this actually taking time.
I think you could try the.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:00
That's great though.

Lem   1:41:02
You could try the.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:02
Is that a correct?
Orderly shaped well, so this is almost like for investments basically.

Lem   1:41:09
Probability of default.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:13
It's just a good port.

Lem   1:41:14
Yeah. I mean, I think so.
Let's try the first research.
First research was much faster a while ago or we can't stop it.
That's odd.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:28
You can't.
Or you can't.
You just can't stop it.

Lem   1:41:30
Yeah, I can't stop the. Yeah, it won't pass.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:31
It will pause.

Lem   1:41:37
Or credit report.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:40
That's what it just gave us.

Lem   1:41:41
Credit score.
Yeah, I think this is like, yeah, I think the credit score or, yeah, credit report for a company.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:43
So this is just for credit, OK?
Uh, huh. Interesting.

Lem   1:41:51
But yeah, so that was good.
ChatGPT was able to like get that particular.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:56
Take information from it, yeah.

Lem   1:41:59
Yeah.
Yeah, this is this 40 is actually quite good.
Also on.
On researching.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:09
I wonder if it is it.
Posted I I was like the the original report that we clicked on is that almost like a custom GPT. But for martini? Yeah, exactly. OK.

Lem   1:42:31
Yeah, yeah, I think.
I think yeah, that that's what they're doing usually for like the SAS.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:35
Yeah.

Lem   1:42:38
Now they just it's like a custom ChatGPT or custom like cloud or something.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:38
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:42:44
Then they edit the like.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:45
And put a lot of data into it and just.

Lem   1:42:47
Yeah. Then they edited.
Yeah, they just like tweak the code to focus on their particular use case.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:53
Yeah.
It was pulled from its live market.

Lem   1:42:58
Yeah, this actually I think it's.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:59
That's.

Lem   1:43:02
The data is.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:05
At least recent, if nothing else.

Lem   1:43:06
Yeah. Yeah. Recent. Yeah, that's right.
It's actually good martini dot AI.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:13
Yeah.

Lem   1:43:19
Yeah, I think I'm not sure if.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:22
Which one you want to prefer?

Lem   1:43:24
Yeah, I think ChatGPT is also doing a a great job.
Yeah, sometimes.
But I'm just using actually just sonar Pro, so yeah, they have also have like sonar deep research.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:32
Stoto pro.
I don't know if.
OK.

Lem   1:43:44
Yeah, but this is much cheaper.
That's on our pro one.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:48
Yeah, that's what I'm.

Lem   1:43:49
And this is also much cheaper. Gpt 40 is cheaper, but yeah, the output is actually quite good.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:53
They're both.
They're both of them.

Lem   1:43:56
Yeah, the GPT 4 OS.
Yeah, this one GPT 4 OS. Very cheap.
Also so and if if Peter already thinks this is like good.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:04
Excuse me.
Like sufficient? Yeah.

Lem   1:44:09
So yeah, yeah, this would be actually great because this is actually much cheaper. Gpt 40 compared I think to this perplexity 1.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:15
Yeah.
Perplexity. OK.

Lem   1:44:19
Yeah. So we could like search like 10 companies per day or something.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:22
Yeah.

Lem   1:44:27
Yeah. And then so yes, as you can see, the total tokens use is only 1600, so if, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:35
Oh wow. I didn't even know you could look at that in.

Lem   1:44:38
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:38
Is that in every output?

Lem   1:44:40
Yeah, that's right.
It's in every app, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:41
I've never looked at that 'cause. I was trying to get that information on Friday.
I was like, I went on to my actual things and I was looking it up, but that's great.

Lem   1:44:46
I see.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we could actually see the. Yeah, the usage I think. Yeah, I think perplexity also.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:53
Exact number you do.

Lem   1:44:57
Let me just try.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:58
Does the same thing.

Lem   1:44:59
Yeah, they they also have like a token usage.
So that like we can estimate the?

Bryan Wolf   1:45:06
And that is almost solely based on the like the actual model that you pick. You think, yeah.

Lem   1:45:06
The use.
Yeah, that's right.
So Solena Pro has like, how much was that available?

Bryan Wolf   1:45:14
So.

Lem   1:45:18
I said like 12/2 plus like $7.00 per million tokens I think. But yeah so.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:23
Uh huh.
Go ahead.

Lem   1:45:27
For this one.
Yeah, I think, yeah, all they don't put the usage here. Yeah, that's.
Oh, they're here.
It's a usage so 1365.
So it's actually, yeah, quite cheap for the sonar pro. So this wouldn't take much.
Maybe a couple of maybe less than $10 per month if yeah, we research.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:52
Mm hmm, mm hmmerer in a full time.

Lem   1:45:53
So we would just, yeah, running daily.
Like for 10 companies and stuff.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:59
What are those search results good.
Oh, it just says just click on one, OK?

Lem   1:46:02
Yeah, the citations, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:04
Yeah, yeah, that's what I thought.

Lem   1:46:05
These are the yeah.
Yeah, it's just this one.
I'm yeah, I'm not really.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:14
You don't like the way it 'cause? It didn't? Yeah, for sure.

Lem   1:46:14
Happy with? Yeah, this one says.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:17
It felt short in a little bit.

Lem   1:46:19
Yeah, compared to the chat GPU and I think this is.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:21
This gives it much more in depth like.

Lem   1:46:23
Yeah, much in depth in that, that section.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:26
It actually explains it versus the other ones. Just trying to take like the actual like the Proms, just couple numbers and investment.

Lem   1:46:30
Yeah, that's right.
Uh.
Yeah. So I think you could also use this one.
Yeah. So vincey, there's like 2022 overview also 23, but I think we I could we get a little bit for perplexity.
Just like. Yeah, like, yeah, to get this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:51
I got to get there.
Yeah. Do you prefer perplexity?
Is that why you chose that one first?

Lem   1:46:57
Not in the past.
I was using perplexity, but when I like played around also with GPT 4 or now that it's actually outputting good. So yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:05
Uh huh.
Yeah.

Lem   1:47:09
Because of course it would really depend on the output, right?
So if this output's better, so I think it's better to use this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:12
Right.

Lem   1:47:16
Yeah, so I think.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:18
All right, I agree.

Lem   1:47:19
But yeah, in the past I've actually yeah, using.
For researching the Internet. Yeah, perplexities.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:26
Is much better that you like, OK.

Lem   1:47:26
The one that I, yeah, I think, yeah. I think perplexity now is much more on, like, the deep research they I think they have like.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:35
Better than Cha Cha BU 2.

Lem   1:47:37
I'm not too sure.
Also, because ChatGPT now also have the deep research.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:41
Is really good too.

Lem   1:47:41
Yeah, they have.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:42
I know they just put out a new model on like Saturday.

Lem   1:47:45
Like yeah, they actually already have.
Also, deep research so.
That's yeah, this actually looks good, 2024. And then this is like Q 1/20/25.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:52
It does.
It does look good.

Lem   1:47:56
So this is very recent, very recent.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:56
Yeah, for the reason, yeah.

Lem   1:47:58
Yeah, that was actually good, yeah.
And then what?
I will do.
Here is.
Yeah, we connect this one to the like formatter and then.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:11
Mm hmm.

Lem   1:48:14
Just then I'll for the formatter we could just use the like the cheaper version like GPT 40 mini because we would just. This is a much much cheaper. Yeah this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:26
What do you mean for the for matter this?
So that's what this next step is going to do this next, OK.

Lem   1:48:30
Yeah, yeah.
So this is just a format because as you can see here, right.
The formatting here is like like that that one so.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:38
It's just like, yeah.
So you're talking about the format for the way that it would look in?

Lem   1:48:42
Our.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:43
In what a Google doc.

Lem   1:48:44
Yeah, in the Google doc.
Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:46
Yeah. OK.

Lem   1:48:47
And yeah, on the Google Doc, we won't need the HTML, so we just output it as plain text with like I think markdown.
It's on a markdown.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:00
Right here.

Lem   1:49:01
For yeah.
So this should this is actually on.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:05
Yeah, you would take this out, right?

Lem   1:49:08
Yeah. So I just added this one and this.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:08
Yeah. OK.

Lem   1:49:11
Yeah, because this is.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:13
Now when you added this you you added it with ChatGPT or.

Lem   1:49:18
No, I just you.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:19
You just do it yourself.

Lem   1:49:20
Yeah, yeah, I just do it myself to, but we could.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:21
But I could hear you OK.
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:49:23
Yeah, we could also use ChatGPT.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:24
I know, I know.

Lem   1:49:24
Actually, yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:25
You had said that in the past. That's why I'm interested.

Lem   1:49:28
Format the input data.
Today.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:35
Hmm.

Lem   1:49:39
I'm glad though.
Format.
I think we need to use markdown here.
Then put data would be this one.
So.
Yeah.
For the next part is.
Yeah, I the next part would be the I think the.
Just.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:40
You're gonna go section by section of those visuals on the. Oh, no, you just talked about this one specifically.

Lem   1:50:41
Yeah.
Yeah, section.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:45
Visuals on the earlier.

Lem   1:50:47
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:47
Because you know that was gonna take a long time.
So there, yeah.

Lem   1:50:50
Yeah, this is, yeah. This actually just for the file naming convention then this just ready for logging then delivery for e-mail.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:55
Mm hmm.
Yeah, you say.

Lem   1:51:02
So this would be easy. Yeah. And then you should also carry on Google Drive key data field, so that's good.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:03
They're all pretty standard, easy stuff.
Mm hmm.

Lem   1:51:14
Yeah. So it would be just, yeah, this one would be the one that I'll yeah be tricky.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:18
Tricky.

Lem   1:51:20
So you would need to search, so I'm not sure what this open graph is so.
If it's.
Also like a scrape or something.
Justin, face the line of each page.
I used to pull data from your site. When you share the URL for site in those services.
Huh.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:55
What?

Lem   1:51:57
Well, I'm not sure why this one is your open graph.

Bryan Wolf   1:52:03
What is this?
What you looked up open graph.

Lem   1:52:06
Yeah, because on the docs it's use an open graph.

Bryan Wolf   1:52:07
You know the uses before. Oh.

Lem   1:52:10
Yeah, but I'm not sure.

Bryan Wolf   1:52:11
Why? OK.

Lem   1:52:14
Yeah. I think Peter also made this with Claude, I think or something.

Bryan Wolf   1:52:17
AI.
Yeah, something like that for sure.

Lem   1:52:20
Yeah, but I'm not sure why it's.

Bryan Wolf   1:52:23
There's probably an alternative to that, Allison.

Lem   1:52:26
Yeah.
Yeah. So what I'm thinking actually is like we could use like amplify or something maybe amplify to scrape the.

Bryan Wolf   1:52:33
OK.

Lem   1:52:37
Or like in Google Doc, because we could actually like using rapid API.
I.
Excuse me.
We could actually like search the Internet or like a like particular website using their.
Like endpoint.
So for example.
Or you could use Google, Google, just Google straight up.
On.
Still thinking on.
Just maybe there's like a logo scraper here.

Bryan Wolf   1:53:30
Yeah, I actually just looked.

Lem   1:53:36
Umm. Logo.
Hmm.
That would be website logo Finder.
Yeah, I think this would be good.
Website Logo Finder. If this works AI logo generator no this would be.
Logos from any website URL these two websites to get brand logo serviceites.
Yeah. So we would be searching the.
Like the in the in their website.
So, for example, DuPont again.
Oops.
DuPont.
Twopoint.com. So let's say.
Dupont.com.
No, this is.

Bryan Wolf   1:54:46
Not a free, not a free.

Lem   1:54:46
For yeah, this this would be per month $5 per month.

Bryan Wolf   1:54:48
Here is a pro.
Feel free.
Feel.

Lem   1:55:00
Yeah, I think we, but we could test this out also.
Let me just say bookmark this one.
Yeah, this is the only logo Finder here.
Private. Yeah, I could use this one or.
Let's test this out. Let's say startupon.
Alright, doctor.
No, that's good.

Bryan Wolf   1:56:05
Yeah.

Lem   1:56:06
Actually.

Bryan Wolf   1:56:08
It's the format that's gonna click that like it's small like there.

Lem   1:56:08
Take out, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, it's just small.
But I I think it would be. It's. Yeah, it's to get OK because we would be putting this one on a document.

Bryan Wolf   1:56:15
It's OK.
Yeah.

Lem   1:56:20
So it would be like a small also. Not sure if we could also like.

Bryan Wolf   1:56:23
Thank you.

Lem   1:56:31
Add some.
No, they they don't have some parameters here. So it's just like.
Yeah, they don't have.
Latest.
Yeah. It's just that one.
Yep, it's actually good.
Just pretty good.
Yep.
Then for, let's try it again for example.
Like.
Other company here.
Maybe sarala?

Bryan Wolf   1:57:26
Is this what you used?
How did you pull it last time?

Lem   1:57:30
Pardon.
Oh, come again, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:57:34
Did you hear?
Can you hear me?
How did you?

Lem   1:57:36
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:57:36
How did you?
For the for the newsletter, do we use amplify for that too?

Lem   1:57:43
Yeah. Oh, this is like, yeah, it's not HDI.
Think it's? Yeah, we used appify, but it was like a different actors or like scrapers.
So I've I just research here like a logo, logo, scraper, something.
So this is just like the one that can search for the logo.

Bryan Wolf   1:58:04
Can you hear me?

Lem   1:58:05
Yep, yeah.
Yeah, this is the one.
Yeah, but the output. Yeah, yes, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:58:12
Can you hear me?
But you cut out, you cut out, you cut out.
It's my fault. I think my my connection had some problems.

Lem   1:58:17
All right.

Bryan Wolf   1:58:19
I I just missed out on its like 30 seconds.

Lem   1:58:21
OK.
Yeah, yeah, we we use abify also on the newsletter for the like the Reddit and the LinkedIn.

Bryan Wolf   1:58:29
Yeah.

Lem   1:58:30
Just you can remember. Yeah. So I've just search on the appify store for like a logo scraper.
So unfortunately there's only like 1.
And yeah, it's extracting the logo like it's not HD.
So I would need to like find another.
Yeah, way to so you can see. I've also tried it on severala this one.
So yeah, this is like the it's not.

Bryan Wolf   1:58:52
Yeah.

Lem   1:58:56
Yeah, it's blurry and yeah.
OK.
But yeah, basically that would be the flow I think, yeah, I.

Bryan Wolf   1:59:07
Entirely. That would be the whole thing for for.

Lem   1:59:10
Yeah, the for this one.
So it would just be like one.
So basically I would add here let's say if like for example, just apply or another.

Bryan Wolf   1:59:20
Uh huh.

Lem   1:59:21
Another another scraping or something, and then I'll add here the Google Doc.

Bryan Wolf   1:59:26
Mm hmm.

Lem   1:59:29
So we'll create the Google Doc.

Bryan Wolf   1:59:31
Yeah.

Lem   1:59:32
Create the document and then add it to the spreadsheet and then send the e-mail here.
Like Gmail to set? Yeah, send that particular Google Doc attachment to the list.

Bryan Wolf   1:59:41
Yeah.

Lem   1:59:46
So yeah, basically that this would be like the flow.
Yeah, this one then.
Yep, Yep, I think that would be. Yeah. That's it.
The tricky part here actually is, yeah, this, this the research one only. And like the oh for example this one, I think it I would need also to.

Bryan Wolf   2:00:06
How do you do that?
How do you do?
How do you highlight all three like that?

Lem   2:00:10
Sh.
Oh, you shift shift. Yeah. Shift so that you could.

Bryan Wolf   2:00:14
Shift OK then I've been.

Lem   2:00:18
OK.

Bryan Wolf   2:00:18
I have been wanting to know how you do that for so long.
I never asked you.

Lem   2:00:22
Yeah, yeah.
So that's yeah. And also I think we will need HTTP request here for get the file.
So this would just download the file.
From from the Appify and then yeah, we will. We can now put that to.
Yeah. So basically I think this would be like the flow, the whole flow.
I'll try to like finish it.
Yeah, I think I can finish this tomorrow with a couple of hours. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   2:00:45
Yeah. OK. All right. So what you're about to get off right now?

Lem   2:00:49
Yeah, I also have a call.

Bryan Wolf   2:00:50
OK, listen, listen. So before you do said I'm.

Lem   2:00:51
Yeah, OK, sure.

Bryan Wolf   2:00:53
I've been like trying to work along with this, so I have most weeks for the last little bit so send that to me and then.

Lem   2:00:56
OK.
No problem.
Yeah, I'll send this to you.
