Bryan Wolf   0:12
Yo, can you hear me?
Yeah.
Can you hear me? Oh, my things cannot live.

Nicholas Westburg   0:22
Yeah, I was on mute.

Bryan Wolf   0:27
Choose.
Yo, so I think, so Pete just got into an accident in his car or Mel got into an accident in Pete's car. So it's going to deny him, but he's not gonna be here for this one. Pete, Mel, can you hear me? I gotta change my mic. It's all ****** **.

Nicholas Westburg   0:34
No ****.
Who did?
Yeah, one second. Let me shut the door.

Bryan Wolf   0:52
Uh ****.
Hold on, Nick.

Nicholas Westburg   1:05
It said who? Who got into an accident?

Bryan Wolf   1:09
Mm, I gotta make sure.

Nicholas Westburg   1:10
Your brother or?

Bryan Wolf   1:14
Wait, I just ****** myself on.

Nicholas Westburg   1:25
So I was a little confused. I guess I missed a a lot yesterday.
Not a lot, but.
Um.
Can you hear me?

Bryan Wolf   1:37
Hold on. Yeah. Can you hear me right now? Hold on one second.

Nicholas Westburg   1:40
Yeah.
Is Justin joining this meeting?

Bryan Wolf   1:59
He's gonna be the one after him, so I'm just praying to God that Lem really grasp what he was saying, 'cause I was not really involved.

Nicholas Westburg   2:03
I was not in that meeting, so I'm not so is so Justin works with Sorella.

Bryan Wolf   2:08
Justin works for Sir Allen. Humanity. He's like the head of the budget or whatever. He sure sets the budget for like, I guess their stuff. So I really hope we make a good impression at 11:00, but it's only for an hour. I think he's just going to go over. Listen, man, I kind of ****** myself. I didn't go over the meeting.
I'm hoping Lem is a saving grace right now and.

Nicholas Westburg   2:33
I'm gonna do it right now. Wait, what meeting?

Bryan Wolf   2:35
And of me, listen, listen. So what you what you should do.
Is we should talk to Lem. He's going to go through his flow and then because.

Nicholas Westburg   2:43
No, no, no. I just want to know. So Justin, right, Justin.

Bryan Wolf   2:45
I don't know what he's talking about. Glide like I don't know what he's talking about with Glide. So I I think if we if we end early Lem, we should go through and rewatch the video from yesterday and see what the **** went.

Nicholas Westburg   2:54
OK, so so is he the power automate morning line?

Lem   2:55
Hello. Hi guys.

Bryan Wolf   2:58
I don't know. I don't know if he's the power automate guy. I think he's just like.
I work like somebody in charge like a budget or something.

Nicholas Westburg   3:08
Lem, have you gotten a chance to speak with Justin?

Bryan Wolf   3:12
He's gonna be in the call with us later. Well, actually, I don't know, Lem, 'cause hold on.

Lem   3:22
Um, Nope. I haven't, uh, spoken to him yet about the.

Bryan Wolf   3:29
Sure.

Nicholas Westburg   3:34
You know what, guys? I really wish I could see.
Both your faces right now. I like seeing your face.

Bryan Wolf   3:42
Why can't laptop shut on camera?
It.

Nicholas Westburg   3:51
Sold Jurassic Park last night.

Lem   3:52
Good.

Bryan Wolf   3:53
Yeah, I wanted to see it. Is it gonna hurt this?

Nicholas Westburg   3:55
It is. It is. Yeah. It's all right. I mean, it's entertaining.

Lem   3:57
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   4:02
Hey, Lem. Lem. Hey, good. Wait, Lem. So I wanna know.

Lem   4:03
Hello. Hey, how are you guys?

Nicholas Westburg   4:04
Hey, hey.
Good.

Lem   4:12
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   4:12
Yesterday in the media, I wasn't really.
Like super present for Justin's portion, but I was for when we were going over the AI agent for make. Did you pick up what he was saying with Glide?

Lem   4:24
OK.
On on the on the glide I'm like I have some idea on like what he wanted to do but on the spreadsheet I'm I didn't really like quite grasp grasp the idea on.

Bryan Wolf   4:42
Yeah, you know what? OK.

Lem   4:42
How to like uh?

Nicholas Westburg   4:43
What spreadsheet? So Glide is what like a UI website builder or tool like that?

Bryan Wolf   4:46
I I gotta turn my camera off 'cause my laptop's.

Lem   4:47
Yeah, so something like, yeah, it's like a a drag and drop builder builder for an app. And Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   4:51
Uh.
Oh, that could be a total nightmare.

Lem   4:58
Yeah, so I also have. I don't have experience on building an app also, but I think yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   5:03
Neither do I. I don't think that it's just like we can, you know what I mean? Web design is completely different, especially if you're trying to scale front end, back end. I mean, I I've messed around with a few tools like Bolt. Bolt's pretty cool and a couple other.

Lem   5:13
Yeah, that's right.

Nicholas Westburg   5:19
Like front end, back end builders, but that's like a whole different, you know, if you don't have front end, back end is not. I'm sure there's ways to do it. I I haven't looked at Glide yet so.

Lem   5:28
Yeah, I.
I I actually like watch some tutorials and it's basically there's like tabular data that can be. So a glide is not really for like complex apps, so I think it's more on like.

Nicholas Westburg   5:46
Log on.

Lem   5:50
Um like uh user interface for informations on a tabular data style of information. So they have.

Nicholas Westburg   5:58
So does you want it to be pretty? Because you always have things like stream like an actual like a like a.

Lem   6:05
Yeah, like I think they have their like a bar chart and then like a line, something like that. And then he wanted to do some like the clients can like log in right so that they could check their like data.

Nicholas Westburg   6:20
Yeah.

Lem   6:21
If they are on track, so I I think yeah we can build that one. I I'm I'm not I'm just not sure on the logic because I'm not really like a spreadsheet guru like on the like the formulas, the calculation. So that's the for me would be the hard part but.

Nicholas Westburg   6:32
No, no.

Lem   6:39
Yeah, as I saw on the glide tutorials, it's pretty like straightforward. Also like there's like a drag and drop and then the data is actually coming from like a tabular data. So we could also integrate their Google Sheets on their.
Like if we have pro plan so we could just get the information from the Google sheets, but for the free plan they have like a native tabular data like spreadsheet also so we could just test that out for a start, put the data there.
So I'm just not sure how how the formula would work because the ones that I've that I saw on the tutorials are like static information. So basically they have like for example a user and then like a name and then some information right? And then they put it on the app so that the like the users can see something.
Like that, so it's a pretty static, so I'm not sure how to do like the dynamic 1 so.

Nicholas Westburg   7:34
What? What Excel or what sheet are you talking about? Or what did he share? I mean, I probably I'm looking at my e-mail.

Bryan Wolf   7:39
I don't know if he shared it. I don't know if I got access to that. Hold on.

Lem   7:39
The.
He he he actually sent an e-mail on the this one like the input for customer project budget dashboard. I'm not sure to yeah he sent it this.

Bryan Wolf   7:45
An e-mail.

Lem   7:57
Send this to.
Uh, Brian, Nick, Peter, me and Justine. Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   8:07
When?

Lem   8:08
Yeah, yesterday the on our meeting. Yeah. So there's like a spreadsheet there. There's also like the like the overview for the like the glide project.

Bryan Wolf   8:08
Yesterday.

Nicholas Westburg   8:10
Oh, I got a cry.
Yeah.
The APA APA project budget effort.

Lem   8:20
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   8:21
Yeah, listen. So I I've got, I've got a PSA. Oh yeah, OK, hold on. I got an e-mail from Peter, not Justin. Justin, I got an e-mail from the meeting. I've got APA and then there's another one above that. Nick, it's PSA.

Lem   8:23
Yeah, the EPA.
Yeah, so the yeah, the.

Nicholas Westburg   8:36
Yeah, all right.

Lem   8:41
This one, the PSA is the the uh, supposedly the data.

Bryan Wolf   8:44
So what exactly did he want you to do with that? What did he want us to do with that?

Lem   8:48
Yes. So that is the one that I like. I didn't really get like the whole picture, but I I think the like the the overview or like a rough overview is he wanted to.
Compare the data from the clients and the projection and then based on the inputs of the the because they have like a structure for example I think like the Rs and.
Uh, some uh.
Like what's that? Because I can't see the Rs here. Uh, this one. Yeah, the Rs and uh.

Bryan Wolf   9:28
Oh, show your. Yeah, yeah, if you want to show your screen, it'll be great.

Lem   9:30
Uh um.

Bryan Wolf   9:33
I got my **** pulled up right now here. Just give me a second. You guys can hear me fine, right?

Lem   9:37
OK, yeah, yeah. So I'm just not sure how on how to, but I what what I was thinking and how I got the got it is like he wanted to do like a dashboard for the client that he can.
He can check if like they are on track or something like that based on the information on the spreadsheet. So that's how I I think, yeah, that's right, the dashboard.

Nicholas Westburg   10:07
Visually, yeah.

Lem   10:08
Yeah, visual dashboard. And then the data is coming from like the spreadsheet comparing the the client's data and then their projection. So something like that. So yeah.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   10:24
Sure.

Lem   10:24
But for this I'm not because I think this is or not really like an automation like this would be like an app building something. So I'm not really confident if I would I can deliver this one, but yeah.

Bryan Wolf   10:36
Yeah, that's what I was saying. It was like, yeah, it's.

Nicholas Westburg   10:40
I mean, if he wants to deliver it to a client that you know that's a, you know, a client and then a client will deliver it to another client, so forth and so on. And if you don't have like a fully functioning front end, back end, like I said, I still need to look in the glide, then it's just totally gonna go to **** and it's just.

Lem   10:40
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   10:56
It's, you know what I mean?

Lem   10:56
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   11:00
Yeah, I think we should review the call from yesterday, 'cause Peter talks about it later towards the end of it.

Nicholas Westburg   11:00
We're like, who decided on Glad? I've never heard of Glad.

Lem   11:04
Um, no.
Yeah, I think he just found it out on Chachi PT as he was asking like how to build maybe like build a dashboard for.

Bryan Wolf   11:14
Yeah.

Lem   11:21
Yeah, an app for something like that. But yeah, I haven't. I still have no experience on like that kind of flow, so especially on like building.

Nicholas Westburg   11:31
Yeah.

Lem   11:37
Like the back end. Yeah, the back end, especially. Yeah, the back end up on the because yeah, I'm not sure. Yeah, because maybe it needs some coding or some scripting. So I I wouldn't have, yeah, any idea about.

Bryan Wolf   11:38
App stations.
That's right.
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   11:53
I mean, I'm sure that I could. I'm I'm good with code to a certain extent depending on the the the language, but.

Lem   11:54
Make a complex.

Nicholas Westburg   12:02
We'll see. I he's got to look into this. I I just don't know how Clyde is.

Lem   12:04
Mhm.

Bryan Wolf   12:10
I'm slow. OK, so I'm looking over this budget dashboard. So yeah, you're right. Uh, this is so unable. I think that's very. I'm sure.
Uh.
OK.
Yeah, this Excel sheet is huge. Oh, I just have one sheet on here.
Oh, he just gave us a sample of it.

Lem   12:39
Yeah, the like a sample.

Bryan Wolf   12:41
Well, he didn't give us the whole thing. God, this is so my computer's lagging so bad.
Yeah, here, so.
It's very oddly laid out though. I don't even know what this is. It's like.

Lem   13:02
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty confusing. Yeah, I know. I also like, yeah, I can't, I can't understand like the context here. Yeah, I think we need, we really need like Justin's input about this because I think he he was the one who built this. I think I'm not not also sure.

Bryan Wolf   13:07
Oh, it's huge.
Yeah, well, I just don't know what we're trying to accomplish here. When you say build a dashboard, Nick, like, what does that mean like?

Lem   13:26
Yeah, uh.

Bryan Wolf   13:26
Their plan.

Nicholas Westburg   13:28
What do you mean like a dashboard?

Bryan Wolf   13:31
Yeah, I gotta understand what our goal is here.

Lem   13:33
Yeah, like a dashboard he wanted.

Nicholas Westburg   13:33
Well, neither do I. I I wasn't in the call with Justin yesterday, so let me look up Glide. So Glide is a no code, no code app builder. OK, Glide makes it easy to build and deploy powerful custom apps powered by AI.
Um.
It's a no code software development platform that lets anyone in quotations built, create powerful apps and tools for business without coding experience. I find that hard to believe.

Bryan Wolf   13:55
Do this is this Excel thing is so big on the level.

Nicholas Westburg   14:08
Um.
But for what? What is your to?
For what? This is the question.

Bryan Wolf   14:16
I'm gonna get this call.
Wait, so Len, did you? What did you work on? You just worked on the flow? Yeah, you did.

Lem   14:30
Yeah the agent one so like the for the Google sheet, Google sheet. So I haven't finished it still because there we already have like 2 two sheets so like 2 database. So I'm still building the update on the appending the updating the.
Uh.
Updating the other one, the last interactions database.

Bryan Wolf   14:59
So my thing skips from 1-2 to 253. Wow. No. Yes. So look like if I open this up, I can see the information.

Lem   15:04
Uh, sign.
Glide.
Sure I need again.

Nicholas Westburg   15:16
OK, so Justin, he got involved for what? Financials like budgeting?

Bryan Wolf   15:21
I think he's just a guy to come home with my dad's.

Nicholas Westburg   15:23
Yeah, he just wants to be involved.

Bryan Wolf   15:26
I yeah, I think our dad seems a little bit of Justin was supposed to get on for something. Let's let's look at what he said. Let's I'm gonna go back and look. Listen, very sad.

Nicholas Westburg   15:34
So when did you meet with him when I I wasn't in that meeting?

Bryan Wolf   15:35
It was on yesterday. It was on yesterday, right after.

Nicholas Westburg   15:38
Oh, so I didn't even know that. No, I mean, I I couldn't, but.

Bryan Wolf   15:42
He got on like 10:30.

Nicholas Westburg   15:44
OK.

Bryan Wolf   15:47

That's.

Lem   16:12
They quickly back on his chat.

Bryan Wolf   16:14

Bryan Wolf   17:55
I'm gonna turn down the volume on you guys just for a little bit.

Lem   17:57
Yeah.
OK, no problem. Yeah, I'm I'm trying the like because Glide has like a agent that would create the the app. I'm not sure if it can really. Yeah, so I'm just trying if.

Bryan Wolf   18:12
Great.

Nicholas Westburg   18:14
No, it's it's it's not. I mean, it's not. It's great, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   18:15

Sign in to.

Nicholas Westburg   20:06
I'm running this complete transcript.
From yesterday that I will paste in here really thorough.

Bryan Wolf   20:18
Cloud code with MCP server to access automations to the command line.

Nicholas Westburg   20:22
I I know how to do that. Who said that?

Bryan Wolf   20:25
That's the sort of follow up tasks, right? So I'm looking at the generated AI review of the.
Meeting Ashfield, so Peter and I will be contact database.

Lem   20:34
Dash.

Nicholas Westburg   20:37
Who's who talked about claw code in the command line?

Bryan Wolf   20:40
This is a follow cloud code integration explore and test the integration of cloud code with MCP server to access automations to the command line quotes Nicholas and Lem contact database update update the contact database to differentiate between operational area.
An industry for better context alignment line. Did you get any of that done? Here, I'm gonna take a screenshot of this.

Nicholas Westburg   21:04
What are you looking at? I'm confused.

Bryan Wolf   21:08
My computer's just slow now.
Uh, we're gonna create a prototype of the client budget dashboard using Globlind, incorporating data from PSA and Google Sheets.

Lem   21:17
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   21:29
I'm gonna send this in the teams in a second, but this is really good.

Lem   21:36
Oh, client dashboard, client ID.

Bryan Wolf   21:39
OK, OK, OK.

Lem   21:44
Oh.
Dashboard.
Why does it have?
Data users.

Nicholas Westburg   21:57
Are we even gonna pay for uh, research?

Bryan Wolf   22:00
I think so. We think so. Yeah, we're, you know.

Nicholas Westburg   22:02
OK, so right now action items. I'm gonna send this and it's still running. Lem change industry column to operational area. Combine family details into personal relationships. Lem definitions, context related prompts. Lem.

Bryan Wolf   22:12
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   22:20
I'm just gonna send us.

Lem   22:21
Yes, yes.
Um.

Bryan Wolf   22:27
If you guys can click on this photo I just sent in the chat.

Lem   22:36
To.
Marion.

Nicholas Westburg   22:48
So yeah, I brought that up. That's the context that it's taking.
Area.

Bryan Wolf   23:03
What is the thing I sent?

Nicholas Westburg   23:04
Yeah, it just went up. Give me it's mine's still running like it's using pro. This is really good. Clear.
Let me know what we'll try.

Bryan Wolf   23:25
APA Project Project Dashboard overview.

Nicholas Westburg   23:29
OK, look at what I just sent.

Bryan Wolf   23:32
In the chat.

Nicholas Westburg   23:36
Yeah.

Lem   23:37
Follow up tasks.

Nicholas Westburg   23:42
You guys get what I sign.

Lem   23:42
Good cold.

Bryan Wolf   23:43
Oh, nothing.
Yeah, okay. Okay, uh,

Lem   24:03
OK, uh.
Oh.
And.
Uh.
I.

Bryan Wolf   25:00
Mm-hmm.

Nicholas Westburg   25:01
I feel like we don't wanna get too in the weeds. I feel like that's what's happening.

Bryan Wolf   25:03
Yeah, hold on. Let me read this. I think we're good. I think we're OK. Once Justin comes along, like, I I think today it's just kind of like, let's just get our bearings a little bit and see what Lem went over. He said he's not finished yet. So, you know, let's just.

Nicholas Westburg   25:15
Yeah, I I think that we just need to figure out, OK, this is what we're trying. This is what we want to build. This is what this is what we're trying to accomplish. How do we accomplish it? OK, this is the best way to accomplish it. OK, let's do it and let's build it. That's it. And not second guess. And if there's errors or bugs or issues along the way.

Lem   25:24
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   25:29
I don't need this.

Nicholas Westburg   25:35
Look into why and what those bugs are or those issues are, or an alternative solution, because that's the only way you know, brainstorming and and you know it's only gonna get us so far unless we're actually doing it.

Lem   25:49
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   25:50
All right, let's get on glide right now. I'm *******. That's what I'm about to do here. Research glide API.

Nicholas Westburg   25:57
So follow up recommendations. OK spin up glide sandbox with dummy PSA rose this week. Demo basic variance widgets draft an ETLETL plans are always good. So staging stage validation glide API include duplicate blah blah blah when O data is available.
Schedule nightly pools and store, blah blah blah. Add a lightweight LLM summary that ingests Lena.
I wish I was on this call yesterday. Damn it.

Lem   26:30
Yes.
Change this.

Nicholas Westburg   26:36
And when you guys were both on the call, is this like, is this relatively good?

Bryan Wolf   26:43
What?

Nicholas Westburg   26:44
This whatever I just put down here in turn.

Bryan Wolf   26:47
Well, I'm still reading the first message.

Lem   26:47
The.
Uh.
The summary. Is it the summary? Create a prototype. Yeah, this is actually good follow up task summary.

Nicholas Westburg   26:57
Yeah.

Lem   27:09
Um.

Bryan Wolf   27:13
Follow up. Team should start immediately research with the postation and determine integration. Schedule subsequent meetings for submitted the platforming site. We'll be documented the process. OK, hold on.

Lem   27:14
Yes, Sir, there's already a paywall on the agent.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   27:31
OK, yeah, so we got, we should've done this actually. I should've not.

Lem   27:37
Beta.

Nicholas Westburg   27:38
What is your fault? This isn't just like a two. This isn't just like an easy quick thing.

Bryan Wolf   27:41
No, I know. I just this guy, this guy, Justin, right. He was pushing forward on trying to get on glide yesterday, implement the stuff and get it to work. But it seems like, you know, I didn't do that and it seems he's gonna come in today and it's or fraud just you'll see a sponsor.

Nicholas Westburg   27:55
No, he's he's gonna want to know research. Like what? What research did you do? What can you tell me about Glide, if anything?

Bryan Wolf   28:02
Well, I think he did his own too. I think he did his own. I think he's in common and kind of a lot of answers.

Nicholas Westburg   28:04
Yeah, like we're not, we're not, we're not front end, back end engineers here, right? We all build websites, so.

Lem   28:11
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   28:12
But test discussed problems when it's a database restructuring about the problems. The team should start a major research. So I'm focusing this year on term integration and capabilities. So you're I'll give advice to.

Lem   28:14
Oh.
You can um.

Bryan Wolf   28:29
Yeah, laugh if you what you you want to start going over.

Lem   28:31
Yeah, yeah I wanna share my screen just for yeah just I'm playing around with this like live live thing. Yeah so these are like the data on the this is just sample data coming from the agent but now I I was was tweaking but it has the paywall already.

Bryan Wolf   28:35
Yeah, let's do that.

Lem   28:50
But basically from what I understood we could put data here and then the it's like a Google sheet tab tabular data and then we could connect it to a layout for for example like a bar chart.

Bryan Wolf   28:50
Yeah.

Lem   29:07
I a while ago the agent said they have like a bar chart or line chart here here and then so this is the second table or Kanban something and yeah and then yeah so and then this is all already has like the users or for example.

Bryan Wolf   29:11
Yeah.
OK.
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   29:27
All the users here would have like logins and password and then yeah so I we we just I think.

Bryan Wolf   29:30
Access to it, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   29:35
So is is this manual like we would have to manually do this or is the objective here to utilize the API to to?

Bryan Wolf   29:35
So now for.

Lem   29:45
Yeah, I I think we could utilize the API to update because the one that I can't, I'm not sure on how to do it is how to like compare the static one. So for example this one could be the static, right? Take the the projections, for example the static projections and then.

Bryan Wolf   30:03
Mhm.

Lem   30:05
And the client's one for example we would put here the this is not the client's like a financial data and then this is the dynamic one. So we could just connect it through API and Glide has API documentation also so I I check it so they have pushing.

Nicholas Westburg   30:20
Yeah.

Lem   30:22
I'm not, I'm just not sure on how to like compare the two datas here, so I'm not sure if it we could like, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   30:31
Data's financial data and the clients.
Or projections in financial data?

Lem   30:36
Yeah, this is just a sample, yeah, but basically for example this is the financial data from the clients and then projections is the static. So I'm not sure on how we can like create the like the information comparing.

Nicholas Westburg   30:41
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   30:42
Yeah.

Lem   30:51
Both of them because that is how I understood the what Peter was explaining. Like we need to compare the projections that they they told their clients and then the actual.

Nicholas Westburg   31:05
Yeah.

Lem   31:08
The actual like data that is coming weekly. So we yeah so that's basically the end goal that the clients can see if how where or where are where they are where where they are on the projections if for example they are on track or something. So that's how I understood so I I just.
Don't know how we could like compare it like 3.

Bryan Wolf   31:28
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   31:31
I'm. I think I need to that. I think that's what I need a better I I, you know, a better understanding of the objective here and what we're trying to accomplish. So is this I I just need to go back. OK, so.

Lem   31:40
Yes, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   31:41
So look on look on the Uh, look on the project budget dashboard overview. This is what my dad said that says.

Lem   31:47
We also have like the video recording, right? And I think the the last part is just like 10 minutes. That was like the, yeah, the the glide one.

Bryan Wolf   31:53
Yeah.
Of him just talking about what he wants to do. Yeah, yeah, that's what I was just reading. That's what I don't think you can listen to that. But at the same time we'll be on this call though, so it's like.

Nicholas Westburg   32:05
Lynn, so this you haven't created a workflow for this yet, correct?

Lem   32:06
Oh, OK. Yeah, yeah.
No, no, yeah, no, no. Because I I also don't understand the like the context, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   32:09
No.

Nicholas Westburg   32:11
OK.

Bryan Wolf   32:12
I don't even think we can. Yeah, Lem, I don't think Lem, Lem doesn't have knowledge to to build an app just like the rest of us.

Lem   32:17
Uh.

Nicholas Westburg   32:17
OK, So what? Let me ask you this. What what you know, documents and data and you know objectives of what you're what he wants. Do we have other than the teams meeting where he talked about it?

Lem   32:25
The.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   32:32
Alright, so here's what he says is building an app with Glide, right? So we're gonna use Glide.

Lem   32:35
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   32:36
Yeah. Do we have any? I get it. Do we have any documentation on it on what, what, what he wants other than this, this, this spreadsheet?

Lem   32:46
Yeah, we actually have the this one, the, but this is, yeah, this is pretty like a very vague, so.

Nicholas Westburg   32:49
The dock.

Bryan Wolf   32:52
That's what I'm talking. That's what I'm reading off right now. That's just the over he wants.

Nicholas Westburg   32:56
OK.

Lem   32:56
Yeah, so designed for a cancer user friendly dashboard. You can they log in and project their data. Yeah, the certain then include visualizations such as bar charts and line graph, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   32:58
Alright.

Bryan Wolf   32:58
2.
So we're just converting this to like an easy like. I don't think Glide's like a real sophisticated app. He just wants something that we can click on that'll show pictures of the data so it's easier to digest instead of scrolling through endless columns of of Excel.

Lem   33:17
Yeah, I think let me just, I think Zoho has like a dashboard also I I'm I'm just not sure if they have like that capability wherein the clients could log in so.
Uh, maybe. Uh, because.

Nicholas Westburg   33:34
So the way that I, I, I, I think to approach something like this, we need planning. We should plan a day. That's I, you know, plan a day, right. OK, do some research plan. Everybody does some research on. OK, we have this document of.

Lem   33:38
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   33:39
I getting phone problem.

Lem   33:46
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   33:53
You know the brief overview. We have this project budget dashboard overview right with, you know, steps, what he wants.
Right. And then we also have.

Lem   34:06
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   34:09
Spreadsheet.
And now we can plan and do some research on how do we build something like this? Do we want?

Lem   34:18
Yeah, I I I also can't understand like the data here, so I'm not sure what we are.

Bryan Wolf   34:26
Well, it's just a sample. I don't 'cause I think the real data is like.
It's their PSA is like, yeah, it's like restricted. We don't really get access to it.

Nicholas Westburg   34:32
It's the O data. It's the private O data.

Lem   34:35
Oh, OK.
Yes, but we we we need more context I think because like like how how would if this is the data like where is the like the static one, the projected static. So I'm not sure.

Nicholas Westburg   34:38
That's what I've been. That's what I want. That's what we need. But.

Bryan Wolf   34:50
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, if you go through it, it's a little bit there, but it's very confusing. You know what this this sample is just, I don't know if I really like it.

Lem   34:55
This one.

Nicholas Westburg   35:00
So the static, so that Excel sheet is representing, you know the the spreadsheets representing the.

Lem   35:01
I yeah, I I.

Bryan Wolf   35:06
The Google sheet. Yeah, the information that we're using.

Nicholas Westburg   35:09
OK, uh.

Lem   35:11
Yes, yeah, he said that they use this as like a test data, but really because the the one that he showed yesterday was different, it actually, yeah, it was a different one with.
Uh, for me less it stops it.

Bryan Wolf   35:30
It was bigger. It was the full version. It was the full version of it.

Nicholas Westburg   35:32
Yeah, OK.

Lem   35:32
Oh, OK, yeah, yeah. So I can't really understand the.

Bryan Wolf   35:35
This.

Nicholas Westburg   35:35
So I think we, we, you know, we, we, we wait, we wait to get some more context. So what I would do right is I would have this document processed, analyzed with what we have now and say, hey, this is what the boss wants, this is what we want to build.

Lem   35:50
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   35:52
What questions should I ask for more context, right? In order to achieve this build and what we're looking to do, right? Whether whatever LLM or how you want to approach it with a good prompt, OK, dissect this, come up with some good research prompts. What is?
How do we accomplish this build here? This is the goal. This is what we have. You know, is it good? Is it bad? What else do we need to do? What is missing? What are some good questions to ask Peter in regards to this, this dashboard, right mentioned that you know we don't have access to the SA SAP data.

Lem   36:26
OK. Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   36:30
Odata yet, right? We'll transition to that overtime, uh, and and kind of really just dissect what we have now and then come prepared with questions and.

Bryan Wolf   36:40
I think we just need to like I think I agree with everything you just said. We gotta take this project budget dashboard, put in JGT and ask for other you know websites or or like app functions that we could use other than Glide or because I don't know if Glide's gonna work because the paywall and.
You know, maybe we're gonna have to pick something regardless, but I think we just need to take this Excel sheet that we have the sample data and just make it into an interactive graph that like.

Nicholas Westburg   37:05
I mean, yeah, I don't. I don't see this being a big issue. I mean, yeah, obviously you got to do research on, OK, yeah, this is the APA project dashboard. This is what we want built, right? This is what we have now aside for whatever glider, not glide, right? This is the objective.
Right, this is a.

Lem   37:25
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   37:27
The big objective This is what we are looking to build. How do we build this? How do we conduct research on the best way to build this? What tools, what methods can we achieve this? And then how to do it?
Right. Like planning, researching, finding the facts, understanding the facts and then coming to the conclusion simply, OK, this is the best method. This is how we're going to do this. And I think, you know, I think that this shouldn't be that difficult.

Bryan Wolf   38:02
I'm glad.

Lem   38:05
Mm.

Bryan Wolf   38:07
Lem, you what'd you say about Lem? What did you? Well, I think he just like Lem said, I think he just put it in a chance on the C and it gave it. He chose the first option and ran with it. Lem, what was the second thing you took about? Search the ZZO have.

Lem   38:07
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   38:08
He seems. He seems pretty set on glide, though. That's the thing, Brian.

Lem   38:10
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   38:14
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   38:23
Pardon.

Bryan Wolf   38:25
The the other website that there was an alternative to collide called Zoha versus.

Lem   38:26
The.
No Zoho is just like a CRM platform but they have like a a dashboard like a just like a database for the customer like customer relationship management database. So depending on CRM like.

Bryan Wolf   38:34
What is CRM stand for?
Yeah.

Lem   38:46
Like click up air table. So they they're basically it's like a Google sheet that is like more flexible that they like a better Google sheet. So something like that. But Zoho has like a dashboard.
Yeah, creating a dashboard and I'm not, I'm just not sure if because I think this is not we could just link like give the link to the dashboard to the client so that they can see and it's not really like an app per say.
But yes, so that would be like the if Peter really wants like an app this this would be like a different. But basically yeah this is like a Google sheet that have has like a more more.

Bryan Wolf   39:25
Yeah.

Lem   39:34
Like more features and it can create like a dashboard that is, yeah, like the bar chart, line chart, something like that. Yeah, but this is not like an app creation platform, it's just.
Like, yeah, like a CRM platform, like a database platform. Yep, so.
If, uh, building an app, I I really don't have like experience on it yet, so yeah, this would be a Yep.

Bryan Wolf   40:05
No, I know, I know. You're saying that's OK, love. If that is what he wants to, then you'll have to.

Lem   40:10
Yep. Um.
Yeah, I think the bigger question also here is like the like the main context. For example if this is the the test data, so I on like what?

Bryan Wolf   40:17
So.

Lem   40:30
What are we comparing it to? So I also don't know if yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   40:37
I think right now all you need to work on is we need to work on the flows. I think this other stuff is more so for like Justin and and Peter, myself and Nick. I mean, your help is obviously totally wanted, but I think, I think for us like it's more so flows and we're gonna keep pushing on Mink.

Nicholas Westburg   40:48
Yeah.

Lem   40:48
OK.
OK.
OK, no problem.

Bryan Wolf   40:55
And then we're gonna switch to power automate. I know that's not a system you're familiar with, but I think right now we're just we're gonna keep pushing forward on the flows. So why don't we go over the tweaks you made to?

Lem   41:04
OK.
Yep, sure, sure thing. So now yeah, so the prompt here is like pretty long because now and this is still not complete. So I would be adding still for the prompt because we need the.
Like the adding the data to the other spreadsheet. So I haven't built that out yet. The prompt and also the the updating. Yeah so we need to yeah I need to build 2 tools for the agent. So basically the one will update the.
The the contact and then also the the other one would update the other spreadsheet, this one. So yeah, but yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   41:45
Done.
Really.
And which one's which? I know one's for interactions and one's for the parents, right?

Lem   42:00
Yeah, the yeah, the other one is for interactions and then the other this one is for just like personal details. So yeah, personal details and.

Bryan Wolf   42:08
No.

Lem   42:13
With all of the, yeah, the.
Updated because you wanted to have the contact category, source, business relationships. It's the other one here, yeah, and then it's for the finding of data. It's working and also adding data. So the trickier part here.
Actually would be like cross referencing data from the two spreadsheets or the two databases like this one and this one so.

Bryan Wolf   42:40
Hi.
Yeah.
Right.

Lem   42:50
Like it would be actually doable but like there would be like a few steps involved because yeah ChatGPT won't get like the context on cross referencing data on like this this particular system. So it would be like getting first the data here on last interaction then if you already got.

Bryan Wolf   43:03
Yeah.

Lem   43:09
The name. Now you could push the push it into here on the contact card and get all of the data that is needed. So that is how I tested it a while ago. So for example.
Let's see the interaction. So uh.
Can you you find me the person?
Persons who I met at the AFP conference, so this should trigger the one on the interactions tool and then.
Yeah, so the Luna and Logan and then so as as you can see there's still not the there's no like personal information here. So the the two step would be can you give me all the all information about Logan. So now it will go to the other.
The other tool, so it will go to the this one, the contact card and then get all of the data coming from Logan. So now Logan Taylor has the company role, industry, business, yeah, so something like that and Yep.

Bryan Wolf   44:27
Right.

Lem   44:29
So this is, yeah, so the the one, yeah, but Peter really wants like the like very flexible ones. So I think, yeah, like the yeah, the vector database would be I think.

Bryan Wolf   44:38
Flexible. I like what you mean.

Lem   44:44
Like better for that one because basically what is happening here is it's like we are just like filtering out the data through Google Sheets and then we're finding the right participant, right contact using check GPT. Also for example this one.
So yeah, and but if yeah, I I think this this would actually work if like.
The category of course it's actually already working, it's just that it would get confused when cross referencing the two data points I think.

Bryan Wolf   45:27
Correct. Um.

Lem   45:30
Yeah, so yes, but basically I already explained this to Peter that it's like a two step process like first if we you need want to get the information from from last interaction through the contact card, so.
You would ask first, so like it will trigger here. For example, can you give me all the persons that has like a black hair or for example personal relationships, the one that is from like my school alumni and then it will it will search here and then can you give me a last interaction for the.
Person so it will search that particular person which is Jones, this Zoe Jones. So it will search it here on the last interaction. So that is how I designed this system. So it's like a two step process.

Bryan Wolf   46:23
1.

Lem   46:23
To yeah to yeah to basically cross reference them both. So it's a two step process. And yeah, so the prompt for this is.

Bryan Wolf   46:36
Very long.

Lem   46:37
Yeah, this one now. So this has just the three primary primary functions I think. Or yeah, three primary functions. So I would still need to update this this particular this particular prompt with.
Uh.
Uh two tools so we need we need add data. So this one is adding data to the contact card. So we also need uh the tool for.
Add data to Uh interactions.
And then also so we need 6 tools actually. So we need update data in interactions and then also update data in contact card.
So the one that I've built is these three. I need the the four. So I need. I still need to build the two, the two tools and then add it here on the task. So this would be like.
Yeah, it would be pretty long prompt. So we already have three tasks here, yes. So basically the end goal is to have six tasks, which is it can add data and then can update that data if it's for example this one.

Bryan Wolf   47:52
OK.

Lem   48:03
As you can see it the the business relationships and personal relationships is empty because I just said can you add to my contact details James Johnson then I I the his company is Thinkingrich. He was the CEO in Thinkingrich and then.

Bryan Wolf   48:13
In.

Lem   48:18
Like Sally introduced me, introduced me to him and then he was he has a black hair and then I didn't add like the business relation person relationship. So yet the agent just added this one. So I have added it to the prompt if there's no if there's no information on this.

Bryan Wolf   48:23
Yeah.

Lem   48:38
This one it would just it would still go be a like it would still pass through and then just put empty string here and then if I want to update this one. So yeah we need that tool to update this one like search for this particular person and then update that one.
So Yep, so yeah, this one would be like the automation for that one search rows and then update the row. So the like the like the automations here as you can see, it's not really complicated. The complicated, yeah, the complicated one here would be like the logic of the.

Bryan Wolf   49:05
Yeah.

Lem   49:09
The logic of the whole system and how you how we how we would say it to the agent or how we would prompt it to do the task that we want it to do. So like that for the instructions like this task will use the tool so we need to like tell it that it will.

Bryan Wolf   49:21
Right.

Lem   49:27
That it would only use this particular tool for this particular task, so something like that. So this is the like the complex, not really complex, but the like more challenging part on this particular build the how to prompt the AI agent to do, yeah to do basically do.

Bryan Wolf   49:50
It does.
It's very you know straightforward.

Lem   49:59
The of course the logic here was also like for example this one has some logic also the like the filtering out. So I've added the logic also to the chat the ChatGPT or the AA agent that it that it will search for that filter.
Just one word so that we could just narrow down the search. So yeah, so basically, yeah, that that's the overview. So this is still not complete. I would need to add.

Bryan Wolf   50:31
Yeah.

Lem   50:32
Yeah, this the four are the three tools here on the A agent, so would get that three tools. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   50:36
Go ahead.
Good.

Lem   50:42
Yeah, so Nick, what was what were you saying about like the MCP on is was that on make make.com the MCP, their MCP module?

Nicholas Westburg   50:55
Yeah, I'll pull it up. I I got really busy yesterday, but I'll pull it up here. I'm gonna test, try to test it out. I'll just.

Lem   51:01
OK. Yeah. I'm also curious on, so yeah, I I for some like these past few days, I haven't had the time to like like research or do some like personal research because I also have some commitments to other clients, so.

Nicholas Westburg   51:20
Yeah, we're busy.

Bryan Wolf   51:20
Yeah, I know. I know you do. I'm sorry.

Lem   51:21
Yeah, it's quite easy, yeah. So yeah, I'm also curious on the like the MCP on me, but yeah, I I actually read on their article on my Gmail that they actually updated their.
Yeah, MCP module. I think there's also they also have it here on the.
Uh, what's new I think.
Like the new updates.
But yeah, I'm also, uh, confident that in the future, like, um.
We could actually like do this stuff. As you can see I'm we're still building this on mate, right? But I think in the future like we could just feed the date like a Google sheet or data to ChatGPT and then like ChatGPT would create this one like.

Bryan Wolf   52:11
Yeah.

Lem   52:22
It would already get the contacts for uh for it or like um.
For example, we could, yeah, I'm not really sure because they are actually updating very fast, right? Like every few weeks they have like updates. So the other systems would basically be like redundant. If it's already we can do it on.
ChatGPT or something, so let me just so there's no.

Nicholas Westburg   52:51
Lam, do you want me to show you this?

Bryan Wolf   52:53
Hold on. Yeah, I'm ******* trying to fix some **** on my laptop right now.

Lem   52:54
Yep, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   53:03
It won't stay.

Lem   53:03
Agent side map.

Nicholas Westburg   53:08
Can you see my screen?

Bryan Wolf   53:09
Hold on.

Lem   53:10
Um, Yep. Uh, yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   53:13
Yeah, I do.

Lem   53:14
MCP Oh, OK.
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   53:23
Or is it?

Lem   53:25
Other the make.

Nicholas Westburg   53:27
Yeah.

Lem   53:28
To callable tools for AI. Oh, that's that's awesome.

Nicholas Westburg   53:29
Yeah, I like that.
So you would understand part of that I I got to mess around it. So a modern cloud blah blah blah blah make MCP server from what we recommend using this new version. OK, so it's directly from make right? OK, so how it works.

Lem   53:35
Hmm.
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   53:49
Connects to your Make account and identifies all scenarios configured with on-demand scheduling. Parses and resolves input parameters for each scenario, providing AI systems with meaningful parameter descriptions. Allows AI systems to invoke scenarios with appropriate parameters.

Lem   53:55
Oh, that's right.

Nicholas Westburg   54:07
Return scenarios benefits. Turn your make scenarios into callable tools for AI assistance.

Lem   54:15
Mm.

Nicholas Westburg   54:16
I'm pro.

Bryan Wolf   54:17
Will you do anything?

Nicholas Westburg   54:19
This is.

Lem   54:19
Installation. So this is for Claude, I think.

Nicholas Westburg   54:25
Well, yeah, cloud code or I mean you could you can download cloud desktop and then I mean that's how you gotta download cloud desktop and then developer settings or?

Lem   54:27
Oh, OK, yeah.
Mm.
Yeah. Oh, I see. Yeah. So if we could like, we could actually implement that here on the like the tools. So these are already we have the tools, right? So it would actually get that, get the context and we could connect it directly to.

Nicholas Westburg   54:46
Yeah, so I'll show you. So I'll get into my so.

Lem   54:48
To Claude.
Oh, that's cool. Yeah, that's awesome.

Nicholas Westburg   54:59
So this is cloud code right? And then I'll show you. I'm I don't have. I think I'm out of edit rate but but if I go here MCP I have a botch.
These are all my MCPS that I can run directly from here, so I have the make.

Lem   55:15
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   55:16
Connected. I just I didn't figure out how to do it so.
So that's that. I mean, I think better when this cloud code's really, really powerful. It is really, really powerful. And then I have the cloud desktop, right? So this is where you do it. I started it. So you go here, you log into your.

Lem   55:41
Mm.

Nicholas Westburg   55:48
Desktop, right, Claude?

Lem   55:50
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   55:59
Right. This is Brian. This is basically, well, this is it's Claude that you usually. It's Claude that you have that you use in the Internet, right? But you can just download it as like in that desktop app.
You have this option up here, right? Which you don't have, I don't think in the web version file settings.
Developer edit config and then you have this cloud configuration file and while you're running that MC when you clone that repo.
Right, like I don't have anything in here yet when you clone this.
Um.
Well, really, I think. I think I just create the file and clone it and then I put.

Lem   56:56
Hmm.

Nicholas Westburg   57:00
To make so.

Lem   57:11
So this Claude is still using their like or all of the data here is on your PC or still on their server.

Nicholas Westburg   57:22
It's under server, but the server's connecting with Claude, so rather than try to feed it. So when I ask the question, you know what workflows are we working on?

Lem   57:27
OK.
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   57:36
It will connect that via the MCP and our credentials and I'll say, oh, this is what you're working on. This is, you know, the steps that you've taken. I can say things like, OK, go through each scenario and each step and run this.
Process flow.

Lem   57:53
Oh.
Let's see.

Nicholas Westburg   57:55
You know, let me know what you think you know.

Lem   57:57
Mhm.

Nicholas Westburg   58:01
I just wanna I know.

Bryan Wolf   58:01
I wonder if I'm on my website.

Lem   58:03
Yeah, I think this is also much more advanced use of the yeah.

Bryan Wolf   58:08
Yeah, it is.

Nicholas Westburg   58:09
Yeah, I am.

Lem   58:09
Yes.

Nicholas Westburg   58:12
But I'm going to try to mess around with it, and if I can wrap my head around it and figure it out and narrow it down, then I'll, you know, I'm more than happy to go through it with you guys.

Lem   58:19
OK, no problem. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, that that that would be pretty cool because we we could basically that's that's what Peter wants, right? That he could just.
Called the automations using chat with your cloud. Yeah, and so that that was.

Bryan Wolf   58:36
Yeah, that's exactly the difference. That's exactly the difference.

Nicholas Westburg   58:38
There's an MCP for almost everything nowadays, right? There's there's a there's a there's a way to do everything in a different way, so to say, to say the least, with everything available today.

Lem   58:41
That's right. Yeah. OK.
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah, so yeah, I haven't dug deep for on MCP so, but I've like I I think I saw it on like the YouTube stuff and like some articles and yeah, the development like the last.
Last time I saw it, maybe a few months ago, it was still not really like very compared to right now, right? Like I think right now it's is it now very used?
Uh, widely the MCP or?

Nicholas Westburg   59:27
I don't know. That's something you would probably know about. If you find any articles or videos, I'll understand it and I can tell you if it's good or not. Most of the people now, everybody's, you know, N8N is everybody's all hyped on N8N, but they're doing a really good job with MCP. They're like the creator of a few different.

Lem   59:33
Oh, OK.
Yep.
Mm.

Nicholas Westburg   59:47
Repositories have a really, really strong MCP that is like actually.

Lem   1:00:02
Mhm.

Nicholas Westburg   1:00:02
Uh, but yeah, I need to do some more research in the make and if you read anything or stumble across anything when you have some time, just send it to me and I'll look into it.

Lem   1:00:02
M.
Yeah, OK.
OK, no problem. Yeah, that's really. Yeah, that's pretty cool. That's very good. And yeah, I think that's where we we're actually going. Like we could just access everything on just from our like ChatGPT or cloud something.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:31
I hope that's where we're going. I I think, you know, hopefully chatting with you will make it a possibility soon.

Nicholas Westburg   1:00:31
Yeah.

Lem   1:00:31
Then it can, yeah. And then it it will just, yeah, like it will connect to our like Google, like Gmail, Google Sheets, all of our like if we just connect it to their their MCP server, right. So yeah, I think that's where actually we are going, but yeah.
So for the like the connections of that also I still don't have like a like.
Experience on that. But yeah, I think that would be the the next level. I think because the one that I'm doing in make is like the like would be an older version and then the next version would would probably like the MCP that we can connect it.
Directly to the as you've shown Nick on the maybe on the, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:01:15
Yeah, I think that would be great because you're really good with these flows and if we combine and kind of balance ideas off each other and kind of go back and forth, I think it'd be really, really, really, really useful.

Lem   1:01:24
Yep.
Yeah, that's right. Yep. And AI is really like advancing very fast. They're like too much. The the rate of development is really like fast and aggressive on. Yeah, it's very like every few days they're.

Nicholas Westburg   1:01:41
Crazy. Crazy.

Lem   1:01:45
There's like big updates on most of the LLM's and also like the platforms like like for example like the we have now like the no code platforms also for building like apps right like.
Like, but of course I think. I think Claud also can be build like the simple apps right through the Claud code, but just not really the complex ones. Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   1:02:12
Yeah, I just, I I remember I was like, I felt ahead at one point, like less than a year ago in terms of like upcoming announcements, upcoming, maybe news, you know, what's available. And now I I mean, I just gave up because it wasn't worth the headache.

Lem   1:02:18
Uh.
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's, yeah, it's really advancing very fast. That's why it would be overwhelming to update it. But yeah, I think that would be helpful also like to focus on one like one strength.
But because on the last time that I've like heard that like the MCP servers is they the like they wanted to because it's still not like widely used by the all the most of the platforms so.
I think that was the the problem, but that was like a few months ago. So of course like the development is very fast and then like basically it would be like one MCP server for that one particular platform, right? Like for example for Google, so it will like or for example for the Microsoft.
Environment you would have MCP and then your AI could just connect and do all all stuff using that that server. So yeah, but yeah, but yeah, I haven't like dug deep on that one still because yeah, I I.

Nicholas Westburg   1:03:32
Correct.

Lem   1:03:40
That, yeah, because they said that it was still not widely used. But yeah, of course I I think, yeah, we are going to that path because it's much easier also to to use, right, rather than creating the tools one by one like.

Nicholas Westburg   1:03:47
Yeah.

Lem   1:03:57
For example, updating the Google sheet and then creating. Then if we have the MCP servers, we could just connect there and do all of the stuff in like for example Microsoft environment, Google environment. Yeah, so that would be really awesome. Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   1:03:58
Yeah.
Pinecone, right? Pinecone, whatever our vector database is even before that, like a planner or an AI like orchestrator. And then after it runs that with like a swarm of agents, right? Like utilizing different APIs makes the plan and then it starts to plan, right? And then it goes from, you know.

Lem   1:04:14
Meet up in the same.
Yes.
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:04:29
I'm just speaking, right? It has access to the documents in um.
Let's just say like.
Google Sheets and the swarm does that. Each has a different role. And then it's like, OK, well, we're going to go from, we're going to take this and then go to here. We're going to get this here to our vector database. And then we're going to go from the vector database back into the make MCP and we're going to create this flow within there, whatever it wants to be.

Lem   1:04:41
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah.
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   1:04:58
And you can have like 20 different MCP's running at once, just kind of bouncing ideas for different tasks.

Lem   1:04:59
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yep, that's right. Yeah, I think, yeah, that would be, yeah, that's right. That would be, of course, that would be more complex also to build, right. But yeah, that would be like the the dream.

Nicholas Westburg   1:05:16
Uh, yeah.

Lem   1:05:21
Like it just like in just for example speaking to Claude and then it can do the the things that for example updating the blue sheet or getting the document. So yeah that's the end I think the yeah the end goal for that one.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:22
Right, right.

Nicholas Westburg   1:05:22
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem   1:05:39
Yeah. So yeah, basically the one that I'm doing is just like manually creating the tool for each of the automations. So, but basically that would be the, I think, yeah, a few months from now would be like a standard.
Just connecting on MCP servers and then the AI bot, the AI can like do its its thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's that's that's awesome. Also, yeah, I think it's also helpful to me like.

Nicholas Westburg   1:05:59
Yeah, no worries. Uh, sorry to interrupt you too. I just wanted to share that with you. You're ******* killing it. So.

Lem   1:06:11
To know this stuff also 'cause of course I'm yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:06:13
Yeah, cool.

Lem   1:06:17
Uh, OK.

Nicholas Westburg   1:06:18
Sorry to interrupt you. I know you're going over your flow.

Lem   1:06:20
Yeah, no, no problem.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:22
No, I think he's done. He's good.

Lem   1:06:24
Yeah, I I would just need to update that other like the two tools. Yeah, something.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:28
I know there's still tweaks. I I I'm gonna uh.
I mean, I don't know how easy we get in touch with Peter, but you already know the majority of what he wants. So whenever we get tomorrow, hopefully whenever we're done with those tweaks, I'll send him a recording of our meeting and then he can watch it at some point. And then maybe, I don't know if he's going to be easy to get in touch with those, so I might just have to wait till.
Monday, but.

Lem   1:06:54
OK. Yeah. So for the glide one, yeah, we would need a more context. I I'm not sure if Justin is actually I received. Have you guys received also the I thought I I thought that we would be conducting the meeting on Justin.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:10
No.

Lem   1:07:11
Camera because he sent us like a glide update but.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:14
So listen, we have a meeting with him at 11, so I know that you get off 11. I can message him now, see if he can get on now.

Lem   1:07:19
Oh, OK.
Oh, I see. So this is for 11:00 PM. Yep, that's right. Yeah. Oh, OK. OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:24
Let's see.

Lem   1:07:31
But yet, no problem. Um.
All right, so this one is for 11:00 PM, right? Because I was also, yeah, I was also mentioned here. So I thought this was would be the like the meeting like the. Yeah, the Microsoft meeting here on the.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:46
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:07:59
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:00
OK, great. OK, so I'm gonna send him a meeting right now.

Lem   1:08:01
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:09
He's gonna join this call.

Lem   1:08:12
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:16
Justin, how you doing?

Nicholas Westburg   1:08:17
Did he get that?

Lem   1:08:18
I just then.

Justin Kemmerer   1:08:18
Hey, hey guys. How are you?

Lem   1:08:21
Yeah, all good.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:22
But so I think I saw it, Justin, I saw that you were on the free version of Glide. So I think most of us, me, Lem and Nick were a little lost yesterday at the end of the call with with what exactly because we were working on our separate process flow stuff with Lem and then I think we transitioned to.

Justin Kemmerer   1:08:39
Sure.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:42
All this data 'cause you manage the budget for whatever, I guess, Treasury Team or?

Justin Kemmerer   1:08:49
Well, so yeah, a little, little background. So I'm, I'm just one of the consultants on the STS practice and usually when we run projects, there's, you know, we're all functional in nature. We've all been on projects before, but at least one person is doing the admin side.
Side of it as well. And that that's been me for a bunch of projects and it's basically doing the functional work, but also doing all the budgeting and making sure that we're running the team close to the maximum.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:11
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:09:28
Water line and making sure the revenue keeps flowing in, but also making sure that we're not blowing away the project budget in the first three months. So you saw the the Excel spreadsheet that I said.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:38
Right.
Well, the the sample or or the one that gives you heartburn.

Justin Kemmerer   1:09:46
The one that gives me heartburn. Yeah. So maybe we want to. I don't know if it's.

Nicholas Westburg   1:09:47
Huh.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:47
Yeah, that thing's intense.

Justin Kemmerer   1:09:56
Good to give you a little background on that or just blow that off and focus on what Peter was talking about yesterday. I don't know if you guys want that background or not. I don't know if it's going to be useful at this point. Maybe it will be. Why don't we spend 5 minutes and I'll just tell you.
Sort of what I do and that'll that'll help. Let me find.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:17
I think that'd be great. Yeah, definitely.

Justin Kemmerer   1:10:22
Let me find that here.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:22
Because all we have right now really is this APA project budget dashboard overview on on Word, which you know tells us an outline of of what I think Pete wants done and what you guys want from us, which is good reading over this. I know you were messing around with Glide yesterday and for us any sort of like.

Justin Kemmerer   1:10:34
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:42
Function or app we've used, it always has a paywall that really slows you down. So I think with anything we're gonna try to utilize to make a dashboard, we're gonna have to end up paying for a premium subscription and then going from there. But.

Justin Kemmerer   1:10:55
Yeah, no, that that was that was apparent to me yesterday. I was trying to just get to the point where I was playing with the dashboard and I got part of the way there, but some of the files I uploaded weren't weren't, you know, stopped in the system and only until I reduced it to 10 rows.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:04
OK.
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:11:13
Was I able to get something in there and then I was able to play with a little bit, but it was still there's gonna be there.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:14
Oh man.

Nicholas Westburg   1:11:18
Do we have access to all that data or like spreadsheets and everything?

Bryan Wolf   1:11:20
Right, so we don't have access to this right here. We just have access to the sample that Peter sent us. When I understand it's 'cause PSA has like a restriction with the information or?

Justin Kemmerer   1:11:25
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:11:31
This is in regards to the O data.

Justin Kemmerer   1:11:33
Yeah.
Yeah, what he what Peter sent us, I had to consolidate and pull, pull back, you know, and I just pulled it back to 1010 rows. And I was like, hey, let me just get something in there and let me see if I can create a little bit of a dashboard that says, hey, you know, here's Bart our.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:41
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   1:11:42
Oh, God.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:48
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:11:54
Hours for the last month. Here's Deon's hours for the last month. How do we, how do I look at that? How do I, you know, I'm I'm kind of thinking that it's really doing a modified pivot table plus charting sort of thing that Glide's doing so.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:56
OK.
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:12:11
I I was getting to that point, but there is certainly still a a learning curve with glide and how it functions and whatnot, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:19
OK.
I don't think Glide has to be our only option as well. I think Peter just kind of saw that as his first option when researching. I think we could switch to something else, unless your guys's intention is to stick solely with Glide, because I think we we could maybe even find some better alternatives.

Justin Kemmerer   1:12:36
Yeah, that that may be true. I think Peter was saying let's just pick our horse and and ride it early so we don't have to do this product comparison, this, that and the other and wait, he's thinking waste time on in that sense I.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:43
Right. Yeah, OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:12:53
Yeah, I I don't. I don't know. I haven't done any of that. I I would, you know, when Peter gets back, I'm sure he's going to want to see, hey, we've we've thrown this data up into the glide and here's what it's spitting out and then probably make the decision from there. Hey, can this be?

Bryan Wolf   1:13:07
Mhm.
Right.

Justin Kemmerer   1:13:13
Our tool, can we, does it give us enough right now that we can modify and really invest some time and energy into it and produce something nice or do we have to jump ship? I think he wants to maybe get get to that point.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:26
OK.

Lem   1:13:27
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:13:28
So and I and I agree with what you said before about if that's the case then we we certainly need to do the the pay to play and get over that obstacle so that we can kind of utilize some of its other functionality because.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:40
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:13:44
It just seemed to be limited for me yesterday.

Nicholas Westburg   1:13:47
I would say I was thinking that, you know, I think we need to research, do some planning, like, OK, this is what we want to do and then do the research and figure out, OK, these are the options that we have, which option is going to be most optimal for what we're trying to accomplish here rather than just jump gun and say, OK.
Glide, right? Like glide's gonna be able to to do all of it for us.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:09
I think what Justin was just saying is that I think my dad doesn't want to waste time, but I also think that it's probably not that time consuming to do that considering we have a plethora of time. But because he comes back Monday and I think, I think with paying for something we should maybe wear our options more than just like throwing money into glide and having it maybe not meet our capabilities that we want.

Nicholas Westburg   1:14:13
And.

Lem   1:14:13
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:14:29
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:29
But.
Justin, so you got to play around with a little bit yesterday and you got 10 rows in there and it just it was that's the only time I was able to like spit anything out or you were just barely just tweaking around with it.

Justin Kemmerer   1:14:41
Yes, it was surface level. I mean, I finally got this to throw in here. I have to restart my computer, but let me see if I can get back to Wide.

Lem   1:14:52
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:14:54
And show your.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:57
So I'm not even sure I'm on the right web page right here.

Justin Kemmerer   1:15:02
Yeah, first before the.

Nicholas Westburg   1:15:03
Justin, sorry to interrupt you. So are we going to be able to somehow like the surround the budget and forecast just to have hands on data and like this kind of spreadsheet or is there any way we can get our hands on it like via like an NDA or something?

Justin Kemmerer   1:15:19
Oh, I might not be. I might not be. I mean, Peter's the the spreadsheet that Peter sent yesterday.

Nicholas Westburg   1:15:19
Or.

Justin Kemmerer   1:15:28
Let's do this. Let's do this one at a time. So let's look at.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:32
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:15:37
Let's look at this first. Why don't we do this? Why don't we look at this, what Peter said yesterday. Then I'll show you the Chevron craziness to give you a little bit more background. And then let's talk about the glide.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:41
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:15:45
Yeah.
Huh.

Justin Kemmerer   1:15:53
And what the what the the ask or objective is for Monday and then we'll talk about Nicholas, your point about product comparison. Does that sound good?

Bryan Wolf   1:16:00
Uh, expectation.

Nicholas Westburg   1:16:05
Yep. Thank you.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:05
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:16:07
All right, let's do. Let's look at what Peter sent yesterday.
So I I think this is our our starting point. You can see that he sent and it's got over 4000 rows of data and what this is, is just an extract I think he got from our PSA.
SAP system, so and to give you a little bit more background on that.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:34
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:16:47
Brian, I'm not as I'm not as long winded as your father, but maybe I am sometimes.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:50
Oh God, he's so long winded, isn't he?
He's very long winded. He just, I realized like, you know, the same way he's always like been that with my whole life. He's like that with, you know, everyone else he works with. So I I you guys understand the struggle.

Justin Kemmerer   1:17:03
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah, I I sort of somewhat nice being in meetings because then it means I don't have to talk.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:13
Right. You just kind of pick and choose what you want to hear too, you know what I mean?

Justin Kemmerer   1:17:16
Yeah.
Let me see.
So we came, we came over to this SAPPSA, I think it was late last year, October of last year, see all the projects. So these not to get too into the details and and I don't want to take too much time here, but here's the here are the various Chevron projects that we've had.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:36
OK.
Yeah.
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:17:47
Some of them are amendments to the original project. Some of them are, you know, subsidiary peripheral projects that we've had with Chevron. Like we did a Chevron blueprint, which was like a totally different kind of budget than the the main.
The main.
Main project we have let me try to.
show you what we pulled down. So if I go to
Just give me a second.
OK.
So every, every project will have, you know, staffing, you know, have the the people, the role, the time recording is what we're really focused on. So you see we have, you know, Zach, he's a junior consultant.
He's got 277 approved hours. Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:01
And this is this line is what he's at right here, right? 152, that's like his current load.

Justin Kemmerer   1:19:07
Yeah, I wouldn't. I wouldn't spend too much time trying to make sense of these numbers because what this really will be about is garbage in, garbage out. If we don't have, if we don't have the PSA forecasts and budget and numbers and hours approved everything.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:08
Progress too.
Yeah.
Right.

Justin Kemmerer   1:19:24
Up to date, then what he's pulling out this PSA extract over here in Excel is going to be garbage too. So if we're going to be doing that process, doing this project, this PSA stuff has to be.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:31
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:19:39
Yeah, we're gonna have to, as project managers, we're gonna have to spend a little bit more time routinely going at this and making sure the forecast is what we what we think, you know, basically marrying this spreadsheet.
That we modify on a weekly, monthly basis over to PSA. Right now as it stands, this PSA thing is just utilized to book hours and approve hours. We're we're under no.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:56
Yeah.
OK.
OK.
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:20:26
Nobody, nobody from management is going in here to say, hey, our project from Chevron is looking like we're going to make 150K next month and then 200K the following month. Nobody's nobody utilizing this. What I'm what we're doing now is I'm telling, hey Peter, he's saying how much?

Bryan Wolf   1:20:29
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:20:46
What are we going to recognize in July? Well, OK, we're going to recognize 119,000. When are we going to be done with the budget? We're going to be kind of tapering off in August. Project's going to be done. We just went live here earlier this month.

Bryan Wolf   1:20:52
Yeah.
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:21:02
So we're we're kind of bringing this project to a close. So these are the numbers that I get Peter, he's taking them from from me, from this worksheet, not from here.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:10
Yeah.
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:21:13
What we want to do is utilize, you know, we want to do away with the heartburn and utilize the PSA so that we when we do an extract of PSA, we're throwing it in the glide and glide's coming out with a pretty nice.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:20
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:21:31
Stuff.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:32
OK. So you you lose me a little bit right there. You lose me just a little bit. So you're telling me that we're we're just putting the data from the Excel sheet, the heartburn into this, this project service, professional service projects, right. And then we're taking that and we're putting that data into glide to get a better understanding of it or?

Justin Kemmerer   1:21:36
Sure.
You're you're really close.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:50
For a better chance to to predict projections better.

Justin Kemmerer   1:21:54
You're really close currently. Currently what we're doing is this PSA system is just a time recording invoicing tool.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:55
OK.
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:22:04
That's all. That's all it is.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:05
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:22:07
What Peter, Peter has a separate spreadsheet that he's utilizing to go to management and say here are all the projects that STS is doing. Here are all the revenues we expect on a month to month basis. Those revenues for every project on a month to month basis, he's pulling those numbers from.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:27
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:22:27
Here and he I'm he's saying, OK, what's my revenue for July? And I go into this spreadsheet and say it's gonna be about 119,000 plus or minus. Next month it's gonna be 56,000 plus or minus. And then when I go over to my.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:31
Mhm.

Justin Kemmerer   1:22:43
Budget summary.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:44
Mhm.

Justin Kemmerer   1:22:45
Here's where, you know, I gave a snapshot to Chevron and say, here's our run rate, here's what we're doing, here's the budget left, here's kind of our headroom, you know, going forward, what we can utilize. And then we say, OK, well, how many hours is Perveen going to need?

Bryan Wolf   1:22:57
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:23:04
The next month and what can we do? How many hours are you going to need? So on and so forth. So this what we want in the future is this to be up to date so that we can just do an extract of this from PSA system and throw it into glide. We can do away with all this ****.

Lem   1:23:13
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:23
Um, yes, yes, yes. OK, alright.

Justin Kemmerer   1:23:25
Because this is, and I'll tell you, this is the bane of my existence, really, because.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:30
No, I mean, I'm looking at it here and it's making me upset, you know?

Justin Kemmerer   1:23:33
It is. It's upsetting so much because you start the project with.
Three or four resources that becomes 7, which becomes an extension for a modification, and then you want to look at that over.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:40
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:23:50
Over, you know, um.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:52
Next about months, years, whatever, yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:23:53
An overlay with the existing.
And then you're doing, OK, well, what's the forecast like what did we have back in, what was our version back in June and can you compare that with what we have? There's been a few times where I'm just like, OK, let me, let me consolidate this and make this easier to manage and then just.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:04
And.

Lem   1:24:12
2.

Justin Kemmerer   1:24:13
It's the time consuming process that you're like, well.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:16
Yeah, it's just completely overwhelming, I would assume too.

Justin Kemmerer   1:24:19
I mean, once you're in it, you know it. But it's just like, you know, I could spend 10 hours on this, move the ball a little bit, but I have a two-year-old son, so that was like, you know, doing that on my own time. I don't really have my own time anymore. So it's like, OK, back to project work, what?

Bryan Wolf   1:24:28
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I got a responsibility.
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:24:38
What's the client need? What does Peter need elsewhere? That's the priority. So this was always like a pet project that always got thrown on the back burner, unfortunately. But you can see here this was like the original project R1A and then you wanted to see.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:46
Yeah.
But.
Uh.

Justin Kemmerer   1:24:56
And we had R2 and we had different resources for R1A than we had for R2.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:00
And this is just the title of the project.

Justin Kemmerer   1:25:03
Yeah, they they do a phased approach. They're like, hey, we're going live with R1A, then there's R2, then there's R2A, R3R4. That's just Chevron's naming convention.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:05
OK.
Great.
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:25:16
Um.
And it's like, OK, we want to see the FTE run rate. It's like, OK, well, we got to add that column. So you're just building and building on this and then you're making modifications along the way and you're like, all right, well, if I just add a column, that should give me what I need.
You know, Peter wants that.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:35
So I'm so now I I'm wondering though how does Glide, I understand the PSA part and implementing into that. Where does the Glide come into for the dashboard?

Justin Kemmerer   1:25:45
So we we want something where the PSA or the dashboard where it's like, hey, Christine from Chevron. Christine is like our client Rep, not a client Rep. She's the she's like our main point of contact on the Chevron project.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:03
Right, OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:26:04
And we we need to give her visibility into our run rate, our resource allocation, what we expect the forecast to be.

Lem   1:26:08
It.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:10
Right.

Justin Kemmerer   1:26:16
and the problem we have, and I

Bryan Wolf   1:26:17
It's all inside this stuff right here and it just looks like, you know, hard to manage.

Justin Kemmerer   1:26:22
This is, this is PSA's output. So what? What? And I don't want to necessarily put words in Peter's mouth, but what we do or what we should do on a routine basis every month is send Christine along with this.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:25
OK.
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:26:40
Say, hey, Christine, here's our two, two months, like next two months, here's our revenue. We can also send her like this is the problem. It's like I know we're all the way over here.
June, July.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:57
Mhm.

Justin Kemmerer   1:26:58
So it's R2 extension.
So really, it's just me and Praveen right now for R2, we've rolled everybody else off. We just went live. There's some hyper care and then there's some residual support that we need. We can just say, hey, Christine, this is she can go in and see these numbers real time, like whenever we make.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:12
Mhm.
Right.

Justin Kemmerer   1:27:27
Whenever we make a change in PSA, that's going to produce the output into Glide, where Christine's going to go in and be like, oh, they just made a change to Perveen's hours and I see that these people are rolling off.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:37
Uh, OK.
So.

Justin Kemmerer   1:27:43
I don't have. I don't have to send her the screenshot of this anymore.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:44
OK.
Yeah, yeah. No, I get it now. Great. Great explanation, by the way. Thank you.

Justin Kemmerer   1:27:50
Yeah.
That's that's the goal. That's that's like.
And and we can do away with instead of using these, you know, external spreadsheets that we have back and forth that there's like a billion billion versions of that we always get confused.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:04
Yeah.
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:28:12
I can I we can just use PSA and put our time and energy in the PSA and be like, hey, this is this is what I have for the Chevron project. Here's the time PSA. I manage it. That output goes in the Glide dashboard. Clients can see it, we can see it.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:15
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:28:32
Because PSA, the reporting in PSA is not good as well.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:37
Yes.

Justin Kemmerer   1:28:38
We we struggle with, you know, honestly speaking, you know, if we did a better job with all this stuff, I'm sure there's reports out there to give us what we want. That's just becoming a hurdle for us internally in our practice to do and get access to all that, so.
I think what Peter's like, you know, F this, let's just get an extract that we can pull out from PSA, throw in the glide, an app or a program that's gonna spit out a dashboard that we as managers can see. Oh.
You know, we're going to be running really late in, you know, September or October, but clients can also plug in to see that, hey, we're rolling people off or this is the forecast, OK, this is my revenue number I should expect to pay.
In September, October, November, December, that's that's the goal. So I think for Monday what Peter wanted to have at least, you know, at least a start, like let's get at least a start where we can say.
This spreadsheet that he gave us, I believe that he highlighted all the necessary like the important columns. He wants name of customer.

Bryan Wolf   1:29:52
Yeah.
Mm.

Justin Kemmerer   1:30:03
These so these hashtags don't, yeah, say no, DuPont.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:05
Hours.
Yeah, that's why another thing is I'm also noticing that a lot of this is blank, like only certain 'cause I see there's like 900 or 900 things of data and I'd say there's only like 600 or 700 actual pieces. Some of it is blank at like the top there.
So we only need from wherever you just started up there from where it went blank.

Justin Kemmerer   1:30:25
And.
Looking at that yesterday, I think it's because if I.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:35
'Cause I'm not sure if we're just missing something, if it lagged out or that's really what I'm concerned.

Justin Kemmerer   1:30:38
No, no, no, no, no. You guys, you sent me the spreadsheet and we can utilize all of it. So if you want to hide all the columns, this all this stuff is like probably for.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:43
Oh, nice.

Justin Kemmerer   1:30:53
I get rid of the hashtag there and then you could see the client stuff. So this free service time I would keep that.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:55
Yeah.
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:31:06
He pulled in everything, so I don't know how he got this abstract, but some of it's for.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:08
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:31:14
Not client stuff. So internal either we office a client like free free service time. Hey, we'll do some work for free because we're expecting maybe a contract to close or whatever that's in their documentation. That's sort of like development stuff.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:21
Hey.

Justin Kemmerer   1:31:32
Other testing that's like internal.
But let's let's just choose like a couple of projects and choose booking.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:42
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:31:44
Chevron's got to be on, you know, Chevron R2.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:47
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:31:49
Let's do.
Your eyes are here.
Actually, maybe let's do this. Let's do this instead. Let's do the customer.
OK, so you see how we get rid of. He may have put next here for whatever reason, but I would focus on our name of customer. That's where we have the different companies and then we have our resource. So the full name Dion Otto in PSA sometimes you'll see.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:21
Yeah.
Yeah.
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:32:40
OK.
Like this personnel number, everybody's got a different personnel number, but that is, I think, the approver.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:43
Mhm.
Dean Otto is the approver.

Justin Kemmerer   1:32:52
I think Dion auto is the submitter.
Is that right? No, keeping. Yeah, it is.
So here's who booked the hours, I think.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:08
Yeah, Bart.

Justin Kemmerer   1:33:09
Alright.
Um, approved by Jan, which we don't need. We don't care who approved the hours.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:17
And this is just for the three companies that you just picked, right?

Justin Kemmerer   1:33:19
The just the three companies, yeah, three or four, some of it's redundant.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:21
Yeah.
Yeah.

Justin Kemmerer   1:33:28
But what I think he really wants, what we want to get to is project.
Resource which I think is I think is this.
Kind of all redundant, redundant, redundant.
The date I believe that's the the you know you could you could create the hours on one day and and.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:48
Right.

Nicholas Westburg   1:33:55
Hey guys, I gotta run. I gotta get on another meeting. Justin, it was nice meeting you. Thanks.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:57
All right, Nick. See you.

Justin Kemmerer   1:33:57
Sure.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:00
And Justin, where? Where's the resource that you just? I didn't see that over there for resources.

Justin Kemmerer   1:34:01
Um.
I think I think that's the green column here.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:11
OK.

Justin Kemmerer   1:34:13
Let me let me make this easier.
OK.
I think these are our starting blocks.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:43
OK, listen, I think this is super helpful. You're giving us a ton of direction. I think you're right by obviously the whole angle by Monday is to have the whole like sample produced. I think if you could physically send me this exactly how we're seeing it right now, I can put this into.

Justin Kemmerer   1:35:01
Sure, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:03
Like today and mess around with it. And then with this small data that we already have, we can expand on that over the weekend and by Monday hopefully have the whole sample done in some sort of visual visualization on glider, whether whatever you know function I'm trying to choose.

Justin Kemmerer   1:35:18
Yeah, Yep, I think this is our starting point. And if you can, if you can upload this whole thing to to glide and I'm gonna do, let's see.
This is our this is. These are the starting blocks. So yeah, that sounds good.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:41
Yeah, great.
He was next and then so I don't know if because I know Peter, my older brother Peter Junior, he's you missed him in some of the emails yesterday. So if we could just make sure we include him today and whatever you send us and then anytime you should have a meeting with us too, just put him in there cause.

Justin Kemmerer   1:35:57
Sure.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:01
I don't have the ability to just like add them in there sometimes to think.

Justin Kemmerer   1:36:05
Yeah, I'll add.
OK, I'll send this off to you guys.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:14
Thanks, Justin.

Justin Kemmerer   1:36:14
Yeah, let me know if there's any other questions you have.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:17
Yeah, I'll, I'll keep you in touch today and tell you what progress I make. And then, uh, are you gonna meet with us tomorrow too or we'll just wait till Monday?

Justin Kemmerer   1:36:23
I'm I'm available if if if I'm certainly available to to hop on a call.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:28
Sure. OK, cool. If you run into anything, I'll I'll shoot you an e-mail or or a message on teams.

Justin Kemmerer   1:36:33
Great.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:34
Thank you.

Justin Kemmerer   1:36:35
Yep, sure.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:42
All right, Lem, how do you feel?

Lem   1:36:42
Hey.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:45
Lem, are you there?

Lem   1:36:49
I'm on mute. Yep. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:50
You're muted if you are. OK, so listen, I don't know how much you want to be involved in this. I'm going to take the information he just sent me and I'm going to try Glide. I'm going to try a couple different websites, see if I can get some visualization on dashboard. But I think that was great. I think he just explained to me, at least I grasped very well the.

Lem   1:36:59
OK.
OK.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:09
Concept of what we're trying to do by Monday. I don't did you because I know we were both confused with what was going on yesterday, but I think I have a clear understanding now. What about you?

Lem   1:37:18
OK, yeah, that's more clear. Like the yeah, what he wants. So like a dashboard on. Yeah, but for I think, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:21
But he was.
Now, I don't know if you want to work on this or not, cause I know you're doing the flows and you still got to work on the flows. So honestly, you don't have to. I just like that you're a part of it. And listen, I think you're a smart guy. So I just kind of like, you know, maybe your input or I know you just were tweaking around with glide, so you can keep doing whatever you're doing. I know you have other clients and stuff, but you know we're going to meet tomorrow.

Lem   1:37:36
Yeah.
Yeah, no problem. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:49
Tomorrow morning and I'm I'm gonna hopefully have something to show for the dashboard and you know I don't know if you have any time to peek around yourself and we could just I like your input on stuff you know I think you're a smart guy so.

Lem   1:37:52
OK.
Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh, thanks. Thanks for that. But yeah, I I can also. Yeah, I can. Uh, no problem.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:00
Hey, you're welcome, man. You're welcome.
Just tweak around. I'm gonna do most of the heavy lifting. I think I'll do most of the heavy lifting and then I just want, you know, another set of eyes. And then Pete, did you were you there for that whole meeting? I was gonna text you and join, but.

Lem   1:38:08
Yeah, OK.

Peter Wolf Jr   1:38:15
No, I I just got in. I mean, I'm in the car right now, so I caught the very, very, very end of him basically sending documents out.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:19
Alright, listen so.
Listen, So what I would do is Pete, I would go. I know you just got a your car got wrecked, whatever. Go home, you got work. If you get a chance today, review this call, review this call and go to the point where Justin comes in the meeting. Justin explains perfectly what we want, what?

Peter Wolf Jr   1:38:36
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:42
Dad wants what he wants by like Monday or just in the future, right? So I think that's like our that was our first piece of real direction. I think we've gone. I think it's great. You should look at it and then, you know, we'll go from there.

Peter Wolf Jr   1:38:54
All right, I'm gonna try to watch this thumbnail before I hop into my into work, and then, uh, I'll try to catch the rest later. Will you be available tonight for me to hop on a call and kind of go over?

Bryan Wolf   1:39:03
Yeah, I'll be good. I'll be good. I'll be all day. I'll be good. But whenever you know, rush to whenever you get a chance, you just look at the stuff and then we'll talk, all right?

Peter Wolf Jr   1:39:13
Yeah, well, I'm just saying if if I'm, if you're able to, if we're able to hop on a call tonight after I'm out of work. Yeah, if you're available. Alright, alright, cool. I will touch base with you. Um, in regards to that. Alright.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:17
Like after 9?
Yeah, I can do it. Yeah, I can do it.

Peter Wolf Jr   1:39:30
All right. Yeah, I'm about to be back at my house, so I will pull up the meeting and then rewatch it and I'll let you know. All right.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:39
Lem, before you go, can we just go over the flow one more time and and I know what are the there's like one or two things that you still need to like tweak about it that are just not working for it because it for maker for because we have two.

Lem   1:39:43
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:56
We have two points of data. What was, what was the issues again? Because I don't even really specifically remember what Peter articulated that he specifically wants that you obviously have a much better understanding. So I just want to know what else, what else, you know, or basically what else we have to do.

Lem   1:39:59
Yep.
Um, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. So can you see my screen? OK, yeah. So yeah, the first one that I've actually prompted because basically the IT was the first version of this was not completely done yet. And then Peter wanted.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:13
In.
I'm looking. I can see. I can see.
Yeah.
Mhm.

Lem   1:40:34
I've tweaked again the prompts and then he added also this another spreadsheet so it added more complexity to the yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:37
Mhm.
Yeah, why did he do that? So would do we add 2? Because it just checked and he wasn't able to and and the AI agent wasn't able to pull both sources of information from 1 sheet. So we had to make two different ones. Is that why?

Lem   1:40:53
No, we have two source of data because for this last interaction as you can see for example this particular.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:56
Or why did we make two sources of data?

Lem   1:41:08
Logan right here. Logan. As you can see, Logan is here and then for this contact card.
We would need multiple data from Logan because for example for the interaction we Peter interacted with him on May 1, June 28th, July 6. So if we put that here on the column so.
We could just actually add it here like July 6 and then like a comma or something. It's just that yeah, Peter wanted to have like another database for that particular, so the difference for these.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:42
Yeah.

Lem   1:41:53
These are just basically the simplest way to say it is for each row here it can be on different or on the same person and then for the contact card all the rows here are just for one person.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:07
Mhm.

Lem   1:42:13
So we can cross reference here to the here because yeah for because yeah like.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:13
OK.

Lem   1:42:22
For because he will be interacting with like some other persons here multiple times. So that's why we need more information. For example 10 on the whole, let's say two months he interacted with Logan like 20 times. So if we add it here on the like just one column.
Maybe it would be like there's like a lot of dates here, if that makes sense.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:48
Yeah, no, I'm tracker.

Lem   1:42:49
Yeah. So, yeah, so that's why it's more I think, yeah, much more easier here to cross reference also. So I think that what that is also what he was thinking and then yeah, so that added more complexity. So I I would need to add more tools on the.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:59
OK.
Yeah.
On the on the prom, basically a little there.

Lem   1:43:08
Basically, yeah, so like adding adding data here on the other spreadsheet and also updating the data here on the spreadsheet. So yeah, that's the automation, yeah. But basically, yeah, now we have 4 tools, so the I've already created the this one, the update data and contact card.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:13
Yeah, OK.
Alright.
Alright, cool.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem   1:43:28
So I will just need to make that prompt also update the prompt. So Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:33
Listen, Lem, tomorrow I'm honestly just going to give you Pete's information and you can just start putting this on his account. That would be easy for me, but I'll do that tomorrow. I have another call I have to hop on, but I'll send you also tomorrow, but.

Lem   1:43:40
OK.
The you mean the data of Peter is I will I will plug.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:52
I mean, like for the future, like for the future, for like any of our flows, like I'm just gonna give you access to his his account so you can build them on there. Yeah, yeah, yeah, 'cause you say you do that for most of your clients. I think that's way easier than what we're what we're doing, yeah.

Lem   1:43:56
OK.
Oh, OK, yeah, yeah. On make.com. Yeah, yeah, I think that.
Yeah, that's right. And then what we can do is because I think Peter is concerned on like the Gmail connection and stuff, because for other clients, I actually, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:14
He is concerned. He doesn't like that. He doesn't like. He doesn't like 'cause I really, I have it. I think Nick has it too. It really makes him uncomfortable. He really doesn't like it.

Lem   1:44:24
Yeah, so yeah, what we can do is if like if you give me access to the make, you can just already connect like the Gmail, Google Sheets so that you won't need to give me the password.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:31
Yeah, so that's that's what I'm worried about. I I think I had that set up now, but you're saying for like when you enter in it and it has like the portal where it's like login with Gmail, is that what you're saying? Where like it gives you the option to log in and you have to log in through Google?

Lem   1:44:46
No, basically because you already connected the Gmail there, the Google Sheets, the Google Drive. So I would, I wouldn't need the access to the. Yeah, that's right, yeah.
