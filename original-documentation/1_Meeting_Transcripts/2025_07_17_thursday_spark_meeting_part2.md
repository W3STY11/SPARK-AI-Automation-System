Peter Wolf   0:06
Uh, so.
So.
Yeah, here's here's my situation.

Lem   0:11
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   0:14
On on all of these process flows that we've created so far, I feel like we have a solid foundation, right? Solid prototype, but none of them are at the level that I need them to be for.

Lem   0:22
OK.

Peter Wolf   0:32
Productive use, right? They each still have issues with them, and my my interns don't have the skill set or the knowledge to be able to work through those things with you, right? To me, they're very nuanced. They're about.

Lem   0:34
OK.

Peter Wolf   0:49
Refining the prompt to be very precise to achieve a very specific goal. It's about understanding the, you know, the exact intricacies of these process flows and and where the the different control points or failure points are.
Are are occurring and or need to occur. And again that doesn't. That's not going to work with them trying to drive that. They just don't have the knowledge or the experience. So I need to.

Lem   1:10
Yep.
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:23
I need to try and pull in some of my other guys on my team who I think may be able to work on that, have the skill set level to do that, or not may they do have the skill set level to do that.

Lem   1:35
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:39
The problem is other priorities, other things that I have going on and and obviously this is causing us a bit of a problem. I've been putting the milestones the same as we've been doing from the very beginning, but I don't think we're doing nearly as much work as we were, right? I mean last or early this week I think.

Lem   1:53
Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:59
From what Bryan said, essentially nothing was done on Monday, Tuesday or you know, Wednesday, Wednesday I got back. I think we had a one hour call or something. But you know, we haven't been putting in the same kind of hours. I've been putting the same milestones on there, but we're certainly not producing.

Lem   2:12
Yep.

Peter Wolf   2:19
The same kind of output that we were before. So that's one concern I have right that I'm I'm still paying the same levels, but we're not producing the same kind of output. I don't put that on your shoulders, but but I think we need to figure out a way that that we may you know compensate for this or offset for this if we.

Lem   2:23
OK.
Yes.

Peter Wolf   2:39
And identify activities for you to engage in to pick that volume back up right to get the the output production in alignment with what the compensation is. But but even more importantly, I need to figure out how I'm going to allocate the time.

Lem   2:45
OK.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   2:58
To work with you to get through these issues, to really get to the critical points that that need to be addressed, right? I I I don't want to just create pilots and prototypes that.

Lem   3:08
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   3:13
Work pretty neat, but don't really get the full productive value. I have to get these to the point that they actually achieve the objective. And looking at what we were doing yesterday, for example, that's not going to work, right? I need that to.

Lem   3:23
OK.

Peter Wolf   3:28
To function appropriately when we put in a request, I need the request to lead to the appropriate result. So that clearly has to do with the prompting, right? And I believe it has to do with the prompting. You identified you believe it has to do with the with the access information in the in the comments field.

Lem   3:31
Yep.
Yep, that's right.
Yep.
Uh, yesterday. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   3:48
But.

Lem   3:48
Yeah, actually yesterday the one that I found the problem with that because it was actually spitting like 26 right on the filter. But when I checked one by one all the names, so there are actually like duplicate names. So three people has like duplicate names so because.

Peter Wolf   3:59
Yeah.
Uh, duplicate contacts. OK, so OK.

Lem   4:08
That's yeah, that's why. Yep, that's right. Yeah. That's why I was also confused because yeah, so it's actually working perfectly. It's just I didn't know. So I a while ago when I when I yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   4:19
OK. No, I didn't notice that either. That's great. But this is the kind of detail. This is the kind of level we need to go to to identify those, right. Because that clearly that's a, that's a flaw in the data, not a flaw in the design, right. So that's very helpful. Terrific. We can go through that.

Lem   4:24
I.
Yep.
Yep, that's right. Yep.

Peter Wolf   4:36
When we when we talk about it today, so.

Lem   4:38
OK.

Peter Wolf   4:43
Yeah. So right now I need to focus on some other stuff before we have a meeting. It's only an hour and a half away and I have a meeting right after that that's going to that I really need to be prepared for and I'm not prepared for right now. So what what what I'm thinking about right now is, you know, my original vision was that.

Lem   4:54
OK.

Peter Wolf   5:02
This process flow would start with execution in ChatGPT right when I'm having ChatGPT conversation and I would tell it to initiate. The more I see this particular process flow, the more I think that this just needs a custom front end iPhone app right that it will.

Lem   5:09
Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   5:21
Work that way better than using it straight from ChatGPT, because I was originally thinking I'd pull the data back into ChatGPT and ChatGPT would do the manipulation and deliver it to me there. That is still possible, right? But now what we're doing is we're essentially going to the.

Lem   5:34
Uh, OK.

Peter Wolf   5:40
A I brain and say OK, here's my here's my objective. If I want to populate the data, great, then populate the spreadsheet. If I'm trying to retrieve the data, then grab selection criteria, bring back a smaller set, feed that to ChatGPT and have it manipulated.
And then feed the response back, right? That ultimately that response could go to an app. Now I could get rid of that part that we fed it to ChatGPT and asked to manipulate it. We could just feed that right back up to my GPT, right? And if I have my GPT and said, hey, I want.

Lem   6:02
Yep, that's right. Yeah.
Yep, that's right. Yep. Uh, it's just faster.

Peter Wolf   6:19
To interact, it would go to the AI brain. The AI brain would say, OK, I wanna build the spreadsheet or I wanna adjust the spreadsheet or grab the information from the spreadsheet and take it and feed it back up to the ChatGPT, right? That would already be where I interface from.

Lem   6:22
Yeah, that's right, yeah.
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   6:36
I really believe that the I call the contact database version will end up being much better with an app than it will be with the ChatGPT, but I see still and want still the ability to work in ChatGPT and deliver information to.

Lem   6:36
Um.

Peter Wolf   6:55
To either store it in a document or put it in a spreadsheet or so I still want that model, right? So right now if you could start working on, I mean either building this front end and saying we're gonna start with ChatGPT as that model, right?

Lem   7:05
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   7:15
And and that would give you the way, OK, you already have this kind of AI brain that says build a document or build a spreadsheet, but B the the the input, the start is gonna come from ChatGPT and then later on we could swap that out within with a app.

Lem   7:28
OK.

Peter Wolf   7:33
But then I would already be moving forward on the next solution or process flow, which is I want something that allows me to work in ChatGPT, my ChatGPT and feed stuff to a document to store it or to put in a spreadsheet or anything else, right? Because for example on the process flows.
I created a, you know, I have a conversation ongoing with ChatGPT about the process flows and where they are in different categories. Do we have a a flow diagram? Do we finish the the make set up? Do we have a fully defined solution yet? You know, is it a definitive solution? I want to deliver is one.

Lem   8:06
OK.

Peter Wolf   8:11
Considering where I am I in the process. So I have all these different kind of categories and if I were having that conversation right now with that interface, it would be in a spreadsheet, but instead it's just inside my GPT conversation and then every time I try to pull it back up or sometimes it misses some stuff and whatever.
Doesn't pull everything back together. So if it were populating a spreadsheet and I was retreating it similar to the contact information, then I would be getting what I want, right? So I think right now I would say if you can move forward with building.

Lem   8:39
OK.
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   8:47
The GPT interface to start from GPT and deliver that information into Make like we were originally talking about going to N 8 N then you said, well I think we can do it in Make. So I want to get that front end portion going right.

Lem   8:51
OK.
Yeah, that's right. Yep.
OK. Yeah. From, yeah, a custom, basically like a custom GPT that will, yeah, it will.

Peter Wolf   9:07
Right, it doesn't even have to be a custom GPT, but if it is, that way I can manipulate it more because it's my own GPT. I can already pre prep what it is I want or when the information comes back into GPT after going to make and going to spreadsheet, I can already have a custom GPT that's going to tell it how to manipulate.

Lem   9:12
Oh.

Peter Wolf   9:26
That once it's inside back in the GPT, right? Instead of us going to make and then feeding it to a standard GPT, right? Having it do something and bring it back and then give you output. I could just say OK, AI brain and make go find in the spreadsheet, bring it back, feed it back.

Lem   9:31
Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   9:46
Up to the the my existing GPT and it can manipulate that output.

Lem   9:51
OK.

Peter Wolf   9:56
Does that make sense?
If it doesn't make sense, just ask and I'll clarify.
Yep.

Lem   10:15
Our AI agent and then it's just spitting back up. But yeah, the one that you mentioned a while ago would be like a different use case, so it will be, yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   10:15
Yep.
It would be. So here's what I would say. If you take your AI brain that you created right the foundation, and you move that to a new, you copy that to a new use case, and that new use case is not a just a, you know, an app interface, but it is the GPT.

Lem   10:28
OK.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   10:41
Interface, right?

Lem   10:44
OK.

Peter Wolf   10:44
Me initiating from ChatGPT, calling the the the the make brain, the make brain and determining do I need to go to a document? Do I need to go to a spreadsheet? Do I need to whatever? Just like you're doing now, but not feeding it to another.

Lem   10:46
Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   11:01
ChatGPT not feeding it to a generic GBT, but when you come back with whatever, if I retrieve information, then you go grab it, bring it back, feed it back up to the original GBT that sent the request.

Lem   11:12
Yeah.
Um, like a custom? Uh, I'm not really getting the like.

Peter Wolf   11:21
Yeah, custom GPT. When you say custom GPT, all we mean is a custom GPT because I have to have a custom GPT to have the API right and the API key.

Lem   11:32
No, no, not really, because the we can't actually connect the. I mean, we can't query a custom GPT, but we could actually just trigger.

Peter Wolf   11:43
You don't have to query it. You don't have to query it. So here's here's the here's the process flow. I pick up my phone, I open my my ChatGPT. I go to my custom ChatGPT and I start to have a conversation.

Lem   11:45
Oh, OK Um.
OK.
OK, OK.

Peter Wolf   12:00
And in that conversation, I've already set up for this custom GBT to have an API that goes to a make hook that can deliver out or retrieve in information right based on predefined statements.

Lem   12:09
OK.
Oh, yeah, yeah, OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   12:16
So then I say I'm writing something and I have a bunch of information. I say go take this and put it into a Google sheet for me. Create a Google sheet. It then calls make calls the make brain.

Lem   12:25
OK.

Peter Wolf   12:31
Right. The AI brain we created that routes the information and says, oh, he wants a Google sheet. Go create a Google sheet and store that Google sheet with a certain name on the shared drive, whatever, right? Later on I say, great, that's done. I get back a confirmation says it's done. Great.

Lem   12:32
Yep.
OK, Yep.

Peter Wolf   12:50
Information stored later on, I say, hey, you know what? I want that information back. Can you retrieve that information? Same thing. It goes to make, it calls make, calls the AI brain. AI brain says he's talking about that Google sheet. Maybe I used the title of it or whatever. Goes against the Google sheet, pulls the information out.

Lem   12:51
OK.
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   13:10
It back up, doesn't try to send it to some other GBT to interpret, doesn't do anything with it, but send it back to me. And So what I was thinking was the easiest way to do this to get started is to use the same foundation you're using.

Lem   13:17
OK.

Peter Wolf   13:25
As the as the as the model we're doing right now for the contact, because otherwise you'll have to build a whole infrastructure for this if you just use the same database, the same information, the same prompts, but you take out the extra GPT.

Lem   13:35
Yep.

Peter Wolf   13:43
Right. Take out the standard GPT where you're feeding the information. So the interface, let's say it's the app. In our current model, current use case, the app, you put the information in. Right now you're typing it directly into the brain, right? But that would be the app feeding it in.

Lem   13:51
OK.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   13:59
The app then goes, figures out which direction it should go, goes to the Google sheet, finds the selection criteria, pulls back initial selection criteria, feeds it to the standard GBT, which then does a further filter on it, brings back the answer. That's what we do right now, right?
That's what we're doing right now. So all you need to do is take that entire model, copy it, and we'll make this the GPT interface model. Now the input is not going to be an app, it's going to be the GPT interface, custom GPT.

Lem   14:18
Yeah, that's right.
OK, OK.

Peter Wolf   14:35
It feeds it. It delivers the same information as if it were the app, but now the brain says OK, go grab the information or populate the information in the spreadsheet. Either way, push or pull. But when it does that selection criteria.

Lem   14:38
Yep. OK. Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   14:51
Instead of sending it to or or, you know what? We even could still send it to the the the interim standard GPT because that standard GPT was minimizing the amount of information we were gonna retrieve back, right?

Lem   15:06
Yeah, yeah, that that's right. Yeah. So we actually need that step. Let me just share my screen so that we you would have more context because the the scenarios actually need the chat just like the generic ChatGPT because it's actually the one that is finding the information for example.

Peter Wolf   15:08
So.
Yeah.
The final selection of the information.

Lem   15:26
Yep. Yep, that's right. So we can. Uh, yeah.

Peter Wolf   15:28
OK, but so then the only thing is all we're saying here is the difference is what's the interface to get in and the interface to get out. And so I'm saying right now I want one version that has an interface with the ChatGPT is the interface in and out my custom GPT and one that's going to be ultimately a custom AP, a custom.

Lem   15:33
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. So.
Yep. OK.

Peter Wolf   15:48
iPhone app.

Lem   15:50
I yeah, yeah, yeah. Actually I already explained that last time. So I I'll also so that you would have an idea. So basically what I will do is I would create a Webhook right here and then I would I would call the.

Peter Wolf   16:03
Yeah.

Lem   16:06
AI agent so this one the run an agent. So basically we are calling the agent that we built this one test assistanto and then it will pass the response as a web hook. So what's happening here is this particular hook is.

Peter Wolf   16:11
Yep.

Lem   16:24
Coming from ChatGPT and then it will pass your message and then it will send it to the our AI agent that that test the assistant and then based on the reply it will feed it will send the response on ChatGPT. So basically yeah that is what.

Peter Wolf   16:26
Yep.
OK.
Yep.
Back to the back to the same hook back outward. OK, but don't you need process flows down below the make AI agents that says call call or is that all inside of just that AI agent saying the call Google sheet, call Google Docs?

Lem   16:42
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. Back to the.
No. Yeah, it's already, yeah.
No, it's already inside the make AI agent because uh, we are actually calling the this particular assistant. So uh, what what we're doing is.

Peter Wolf   17:02
OK, so we don't see it. It's unfortunate in the process flow like that. You don't really see it visually, right? You don't see all the steps, you just it's all inside this black box inside the AI agent.

Lem   17:10
Yeah, Yep, that's right. You you could, but you could just see like the scenarios like the tools or that is being called out this one. And basically what's happening is because I will, I was testing it like here, right on the chat here.

Peter Wolf   17:18
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem   17:26
So what's happening is it's coming from the ChatGPT and it's like typing the message here. So it's like inputting the our query and then depending on the response, it will send that response to ChatGPT and then yeah, basically the chat.

Peter Wolf   17:33
Yeah, yeah.
OK, that's what that's what I'd like you to work on, right? Let's get that working with the with the the front end and the and the output going back to GPT, right? Custom GPT in, custom GPT out, OK.

Lem   17:42
Yeah.
Oh, OK. Yep. OK.
OK, Yep, Yep, no problem. Yeah, I I already also researched this one. So yeah, it's all good. I also finished like testing this end to end like all the tasks and then also the so yeah, it's already working fine. And then later if you want we.

Peter Wolf   17:53
Awesome. Then I'll talk. Yeah, Clay.
Perfect.
OK, Yep.
Perfect.

Lem   18:10
Could just like, uh, what you call that? Like test it? Um.

Peter Wolf   18:12
Yeah, we'll go through them. And I'm, you know what, after this week, next week, I'm going to have, I'm going to have more time. I I should be able to move forward, but I at least want to try and keep things moving to to catch up and and press forward. Hopefully I can pull someone else in who can work on some other stuff in parallel.

Lem   18:17
OK.
OK, no problem.
OK.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   18:31
And and I really need what I what I really need. And it's a tall order, but I really need.

Lem   18:31
OK.

Peter Wolf   18:39
First of all, I really feel like I need to have a better understanding of where the exact components are, right? Because even though Brian may be working on this all the time, I don't feel like he has enough insight to be able to really get to the pinpointing. So I'm pushing him that he needs to really be working with you as much as possible.

Lem   18:44
Yep, that's right.
OK.

Peter Wolf   18:58
And practicing this and what I really need to do is tell him, OK, you know, right now we're adding these. We have these fields in the in the contact database, right? I need you to add 3 fields and I need you to go figure out all the spots where you'd have to make those changes. I need you to add the code. I need you to or add the links, add the.

Lem   19:01
Yep.
Yep, that's right.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   19:18
Inputs, add the outputs, add the additional prompting. That's where he's going to really differentiate. And so if you're working with him or if if I say to you guys, I'd like you guys to work longer. For example, today I'm only going to be able to work for an hour, say 9 to 10, and then I have to get.

Lem   19:22
Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   19:37
Get ready for this other meeting. And again, my time's ticking down right now. I would say doing something exactly like that, right? Forcing it to say, OK, if we add another a column, I want to be very specific and I'm going to say children's names or something like that. Just something very specific. OK, where are all the places?

Lem   19:55
OK.

Peter Wolf   19:57
You have to go into to add that column into the database, to add the reference, to add it as an output, to add as an input, to add as a selection criteria, to add as prompt, all that stuff so that he can walk through that and capture all that. Because I am going to ask them to do that and exactly what we're saying right now is right now.

Lem   20:00
Yep, that's right. Yep.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   20:17
We're talking about the contact database, but later tomorrow it will be the flows database, right? Or whatever other database or document that I'm working on. I need him. I need them to understand. I need to be captured in the videos about where these steps are, right?

Lem   20:24
Yep.
Yep, that's right. Yeah, I could also like because on the basically on our meetings, like to our meetings, we're not like pinpointing like all the details. So I could actually create a loom video. It's just that we.

Peter Wolf   20:35
OK.
Yeah.
I'll tell you what, listen, because this would be huge if anytime you don't have enough to do or they're not asking you meet for those full 2 hours or we don't have other process flows to be working on. I mean, I would appreciate you filling in that time and doing loom videos, right? Go into very specific.

Lem   20:51
We were not yet.
OK.
Yep.
Yeah, no problem. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   21:08
Stuff like here is the detail. If you want to add a field, here's exactly the way you do it. I mean, those would be especially valuable because that's you stepping through it, documenting it. Right now we're making videos on all these meetings, but they have all these meeting notes and they don't know which ones cover which topics or et cetera. But if you make a Loom video and they're like, OK, this Loom video specifically.

Lem   21:14
OK.
We have. That's right. Um.

Peter Wolf   21:28
Talks about this process flow. So I very explicitly at the beginning say this is the process flow we're covering, this is the topic we're going to hit on and here's the details and walk through. Here are all the different places you need to touch if you add a field or if you want to change the document or you want to go from a spreadsheet to a document, a Google sheet to a Google document.

Lem   21:31
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   21:48
Doc instead, what's the difference? Why does that matter? How am I gonna manage that? That would all be huge stuff, OK?

Lem   21:53
Yep.
OK. Yeah, actually, yeah, that would really help for this one also. Yeah, because it was still not finalized. That's that's why I didn't like create a tutorial because maybe I would add some, yeah.

Peter Wolf   21:55
Awesome.
Yeah, I know. I understand. I'm not Lem. I'm not putting any of this on your shoulders. You're doing a great job. I appreciate it. That's why I'm not. I'm not complaining. I'm not. I'm not trying to adjust the pay. I'm just trying to make sure we're pushing forward as best we can, right. I want it to be rewarding for you. And I hope, I believe it has been rewarding to you financially.

Lem   22:10
Yep. Yeah. Thanks.
OK.
OK, no problem.
Yep, Yep, Yep. Uh.

Peter Wolf   22:25
I think we're, you know, we're we're doing good business together. I committed to doing at least four weeks. I think we're at 7, you know, going on seven weeks. So I hope this is productive for you. I believe you're doing a great job. I feel like we're making great progress. I just need to accelerate this and I need to get more into the granular details.

Lem   22:33
Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   22:45
If we can bring these to fruition, that's going to be awesome. But if I if I had slowed down and focused on every little tiny detail, I wouldn't have been able to get the the interns, get them moving and learning more right. I was more just trying to do volume and breadth and try a bunch of different things also so I could get acclimated.

Lem   22:50
Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   23:03
And we could get Akamai into working together. But now I need to get into that granularity and I need to make these things, refine them to be awesome, right? They look very close to where they need to be, but they're not quite there, right? OK, awesome.

Lem   23:12
Yep.
OK, Yep. Yeah, especially, yeah, especially for this particular automation because there are lots of like sections that are working. For example, like the prompt is connected to the like the dynamic variables and then all of that stuff, yeah.

Peter Wolf   23:21
Yeah, Yep.
Yeah, so do make a loom on that, right? Because you, like you said, this is new functionality too, right? You're just acclimating yourself to it. So you're learning as you go. But if you capture all this stuff, obviously I think it's it's beneficial and.

Lem   23:34
Yep.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   23:47
Of course you could use those looms with other people as well in the future for training courses, but it would be really helpful to us to to get that documented.

Lem   23:56
OK, Yep, no problem. Yeah, especially also for this one. Yeah, I'll I'll also make like an SOP so that because this is basically like different, there are different like like machineries that are like working side by side here. So if like you change the prompt.

Peter Wolf   23:57
OK, awesome.
Love it.

Lem   24:15
Like the see, like the tools won't work as well if we. Yep, Yep, Yep.

Peter Wolf   24:18
Lem, that's perfect. I mean, I would love SOPs. I mean, if we could go back to each of the process flows and again, I'll, you know, you tell me when we start running in the hours and all and I'm hoping right now we'll make up for some hours that were missed. But yeah, I'm, I'm looking to get these things documented, to get them captured so that they have the history.

Lem   24:26
