You have you messed around with Annie, Danya?

Lem   2:06
Yep, pretty much, but.
Only a few builds I've built on any 10. Mostly on yeah on weekends.
Zapier, because most of the clients want to like build on no code platforms.
So yeah, basically that's the.

Nicholas Westburg   2:29
Now do do your clients like the.
Are they particular in like, let's use open source llms in terms of like AI and APIs like Llama or?

Lem   2:44
Nope so far.
Yeah.
My clients just use like ChatGPT, perplexity.
Sometimes like.
Anthropic cloud, but yeah, mostly ChatGPT and perplexity are. Yeah, for the most use cases, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   3:04
Yeah, perplexity is really stepping up. I mean, there are new labs feature's great.
So you're over in the Philippines?

OK.

Nicholas Westburg   4:05

The Gmail on the make I've sent like a tutorial to like Peter or the connecting off because it's pretty like there's like a step by step process on connecting personal Gmail on make or the like Google Sheets and also like the Gmail sending of e-mail or searching for.
E-mail.
So yeah, I think we can like do the tutorial now if.

Nicholas Westburg   4:45
I'd wait for Brian and eat her. I'm not sure.

Lem   4:46
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   4:50
I I set mine up.
Google it was actually a pain, to be honest with you, but I did it via Google Cloud so I I got my cloud AP or my.

Peter Wolf Jr   4:54
Come on.

Lem   4:54
Yeah.
Oh, you got your your account right on on me.

Nicholas Westburg   5:03
I think.

Lem   5:06
You've already.

Nicholas Westburg   5:07
Yeah, it took me.
It took me awhile.

Lem   5:09
Yeah, yeah.
Basically you need to like the Google Cloud. You need to set up the like the project and the scopes.
So yeah basically.

Nicholas Westburg   5:20
Yeah, it can be tedious.
It can definitely be tedious if you don't pay attention.

Lem   5:23
Yeah, yeah, that's because I think that is because in the Google side, they like added some like security for like personal e-mail accounts, especially for like the automations, because there's like lots of spamming that's going on because of the automations and they've but for like business emails it.

Nicholas Westburg   5:41
Yeah.

Lem   5:46
Pretty straightforward.
We can like connect easily.
On makemake.com for the like Google.
Google Apps just at four, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   5:54
Great.
Yeah, I would just wait for Brian and Peter and and maybe.
If uh.

Peter Wolf Jr   6:06

This particular scenario let me just.
Window.
Yeah, this one.
So I've actually like sent Peter the this particular.
Blueprint. So actually we can export or import blueprints and make so it would be good to like set it up also in your mix and then you can like check the modules like the prompts and then you can like connect your.
Open AI and perplexity and stuff, but.
Yep, but for this one.
Basically you would need credit for like the open AI and also for perplexity to connect to the API.
And Yep, that's basically it.
Let me just.
And also for the Gmail I think.
Yeah, it was Nicholas, right?
Nicholas, you've already set up your Gmail.

Nicholas Westburg   7:42
Yep.

Lem   7:43
Yep, OK.

Bryan Wolf   7:44
Now, do you have to do it as like the work workplace Gmail or is there any way I can like bypass it with my regular e-mail that I already have, like my personal?

Lem   7:53
Yeah, there's a way actually a way.
And actually, if you like click the like the module here and then click this like online help.

Bryan Wolf   8:00
Online help.

Lem   8:02

So basically this is like a step by step guide. We will need to set up the Google Cloud platform this one.

Bryan Wolf   8:16
Yeah.

Lem   8:16
And then, yeah, if we like open this one, so it will.
Let us go to this one this particular.
Google console and then we would need to like set up the project a new project then like put the scope.
So let me just go back to the if you want, we can actually like do this step by step with me.

Bryan Wolf   8:39
Yeah, let's do it.

Lem   8:39
I'll yeah, I'll just create the.
Let's say I'll create a new.
Yeah, new.
Project in my console.
Yeah, so basically this is the like the step by step guide.
So first is like you can guys you guys can open this particular?
Yeah this link.
I don't know if I can can be send a link here on the Microsoft Teams.

Bryan Wolf   9:08

Bryan Wolf   9:43
Oh, you did what? Last night you did that or? I don't know what time it is.

Lem   9:47
Yeah, I think this is the one.

Nicholas Westburg   9:48
Ryan. He sent it to us via e-mail this morning.

Bryan Wolf   9:51
OK, OK.

Lem   9:54
Yep, this one.
So this is also.
Pretty useful for the I'm just like I think this is the one.
I'm just checking.

Bryan Wolf   10:11
Excuse me.

Lem   10:11
Yeah, I think this is the one how to connect personal Gmail account to me.
Yeah, so basically this is also, yeah, if what we can do here is we can do it step by step and then I can like create another.

Bryan Wolf   10:14
Yeah. OK, great.

Lem   10:24
Project so that we can like.
Do it together if you guys want, so yeah.

Bryan Wolf   10:31
Sure.

Lem   10:32
So first is, yeah, we we should gonna click this one then we will be going to here on the console, right.
And then Next up is welcome to create a project.
So we will need to create a project. So for this one I already have a project so you can just create a new project and then name this tool, let's say.

Bryan Wolf   10:52
Mm hmm.

Lem   10:56
Task make connection.

Bryan Wolf   10:59
Mm hmm.

Lem   11:01
Then just go back, then enter project name and select all locations so.
Keyshawn.
I think I've yeah, maybe I can make it with no organization. But yeah, I think it's OK.
So it's creating the project.
And then.
Let's click it.
So now I'm on the task may connection.
So this is like the project that's amic.com. Then my first project.
So now we are in the task may connection.
So whatever, you're just click the one the project that you've built and then next is we're gonna create.
Eight the this one so that this is like the project and then?
Create a new project will work and then.
And about so we we got first hour, we're gonna enable the APIs for Gmail.
So we're gonna kick the PPL services library.
So I think it's here on the API services. So as you can see this one and then the library.
Then we will go here and then we will search the particular.
Like app.
So let's say we we would need the Gmail or the Google sheet or like the Google Drive.
So for now we can search the Gmail.
We can.
Then Gmail API.
So yeah, we will be.
We will see this one.
So this is like the Gmail API.
So this is the particular if you can see here on the make.
So if you like connect your make that it will say there the scope is not allowed something.
So this is the particular scope that we would need to like.

Bryan Wolf   12:48
Yeah.

Lem   12:52
Allow on the on the on the our e-mail particular e-mail on the personal e-mail site.
So we'll just click that one and then click enable enable so.
And then.
So it's just loading.
And Yep, so this is already already enabled and then next is.
So Gmail API is already OK to give it. Then click it, enable and then if you see the manage button set of the enable button, you can proceed the next step.
The API is ready enabled so Yep. So this one is already enabled.
And then we can go back to here.
So we need.
Next step is we need to configure the Oauth consent screen for Gmail.
So basically this is like a like authentication step to connect the Gmail to our.
You have to me to particular websites so we will connect our like Gmail account to make.
So this is another step for the authorization so.
Let's check it out. So first is.
In the left side bar, click Google off platform so.
Google platform so it is here on the this one. So if I've already pinned this one both of this.
But if you can't see it on the PIN product, so you can just like Scroll down and then find the like APIs and services and also Google off platform. So you can just find it here on the on the table on the left side. Then you can just.
Like pin it so that you can easily see it.

Nicholas Westburg   14:36
That's helpful.

Lem   14:36
So Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   14:37
That's so helpful.

Lem   14:38
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   14:39
I there are so many times where I spend I I didn't realize you could ping and pin different things.
And I was scrolling up and down trying to figure out where the off was for like 40 minutes.

Lem   14:49
Yep.
So yeah, so we can pin it this one.
And then yeah, basically.
We need to go, go to the Google off platform and then if you don't see the Google on the left side, yeah, view all products, the top pit and then pin the Google platform.
So now it's pinned, and then we'll just click this one first.
And then we're gonna go here on this particular.
Portal so first.
Yeah. Next step is again is click get started.
So get started.
Then we will be going here.
So we will put the like the credentials of make here. So if that makes sense.
So we'll just do it step by step.
So first in the overview section, under app information, enter make us the app name and provide your Gmail address.
So put here the name so.
Make the user support e-mail.
So my e-mail is alexipalenta@gmail.com.
So.
And then click next.
So where next is the audience?
So the audience under audience select external click next so external then click next.
Then for the contact information under contact information, enter your Gmail address and then click next contact information.
I'll put my e-mail again.
Then click next.
Then next is finish and agree to Google user data policy.
Me and then continue.
Then next is just create and then click create O off client. So click create.
Then we're gonna click the create O off client.
So we're, we're already here on the portal, so let's check the next step.
So we already click this one. So in the branding section under authorized domainidmake.com and integrate.com and click save. So in the branding section.
It's.
Yeah, I think it's on the other. Yeah, this one.
So this is a branding section.
And then.
We go to the domain, so this is like the.
Yeah. Authorized domain under authorized domain.
So this is the authorized domain we will.
Likewhitelistthemake.com and also integrate.com. So this integrate dot dot com is like the old website for the make. So this they just are rebranded.
So this is the old website. So we will just put it on the authorized domain here on the branding.
So add domainmake.com and also.
Integra mad com.
OK.
So it's already here and then.
Optional in the audio section at your Gmail address on the task user page. Then click save and continue. So first is.
Yeah, I think this we need to save this first.
So I'll save this first for the authorized domain.
See it and then we will go back to the audience and then we will.
Put our e-mail as attached user. So this is also important because sometimes we we will have an error on the mix side if you you won't do the test user. So we will go back to the audience and then we will add our particular e-mail as.
The.
Yeah, other Gmail address in the test user page and then click save.
Continue. So for the test user. So let's add our e-mail.
Then click save.
Then close.
And then Yep, so already added here the test user my e-mail.
Then.
Next step is the data access.
So in the data access section, click add or remove scopes and the follow following scope so you can add scopes and click add.
Update so let's go back to the data access.
And then add or remove scopes.
And then we can just search here for the in the filter.
We can just search here for the like the Google API.
So this one first is the.
Mail.google.com so this is also like the Gmail Gmail scope.
So this one mail.google.com and then we can click the check mark.
And then also.
The Google AP is.
So Google APIs then?
Off user info e-mail.
So I think this one so auth user info e-mail and then we'll just click update.
So.
Then click save so.
Let me just check if you've added that particular.
Neil.
Yeah, so I already updated it.
Yeah, also for the.
Google this one the.
Off cloud platform.
OK then update.
Then we'll just save this one.
And then Yep, basically I think this is already.
It and yeah, we need also to create the client.
So this is the next step again.
So we need to create the.
Gmail client credentials, so we need to go to the clients now.
Then we need to create a client.
Then for the type is.
Web application so next is application type is a web application.
On.
So I think this one.
And then we need to add the particular URL.
So this is the authorized URL.
Now we need to add the URL here.
The URL and then.
Let me just double check this one.
Yes, PPS.
Oh this wrong one.
So we should be putting it on the.
On the authorized Redirect URL so here.
So if it's like a little confusing, you can like just check the YouTube and also like.
If we're too fast, we can just. You can just like double check again here on the the link that I gave you here on the yeah makes a Google e-mail and then like check again the step by step process because yeah, it's pretty like pretty complex also on.

Bryan Wolf   23:08
Yeah.

Lem   23:20
Setting this up for the personal Gmail.
But Yep, I think if it's pretty straightforward, if you will just look at it one by one and then just like all time, then just do what it does then.
Yep, so.

Bryan Wolf   23:37
How's your?

Lem   23:37
I'm just.
So click create and then Yep here. So we already have.
We need the authorized JavaScript, so let me just.
Oh, because I click this one, so delete the item.
Yeah. So now it's good. So recreate.
Then I was trying to.
So yeah, we created the of client.
So this is basically like the authorization on the Google side.
So we're basically like authorizing this particular URL integrate to connect to our like Gmail account. So OK.
Then yeah, we already have the Web client O off here and then.
Next is.
Yep, we're basically finished and we can already connect our personal Gmail to our.
To ourmake.com. So Yep. I hope you follow that one.
So actually we can like.
Because I already connected mine, so this would be like I think I can add another.
Connection here.
Let me just try.
Connection new project.
Then.
Continue.
Yeah, I think this already using the other one.
Yeah, this so pretty much it.
So it would be if you already set it up, you can click the add button here on the make and then just set it up on your and just toggle this one, then click continue.

Bryan Wolf   25:24
Mm hmm.

Lem   25:33
And then yeah, basically that's it.
We have the special user secret scopes, yeah, so this.
Yeah, it will error out something like this.
So what this means is we haven't like set up properly the scope and.
For this particular e-mail.
So I think, yeah, I don't know if like it's.
Having trouble because I've created.
To project.
But yeah, but how is it on your side?
Have you able to like connect the?
Connect your account on the Gmail.

Bryan Wolf   26:20
I think Nick had made just a workplace account instead.
I don't know about Pete though.

Lem   26:27
Yeah, yeah. If you buy like a workplace account or like a business e-mail.
Actually we can like disconnect here on pretty straightforward.
You will just.

Bryan Wolf   26:36
Yeah.

Lem   26:37
Yeah, you will just like add and then sign in with Google and then just sign in with your business e-mail or like a Google Workspace e-mail.
So this is only for like the personal e-mail. So they have like some like.

Bryan Wolf   26:46
Mm hmm.

Lem   26:52
Gated way to.
Like prevent for like the spammers or something so.
It's on the Google site.
It's not on the make site, so yeah, basically that's.
That's it then.
Let me just Yep, so.
Yeah. Do you guys have any questions on the on so far on?

Bryan Wolf   27:14
No, I think I think we're good on so far in the getting the Google account set up.

Lem   27:15
What?
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. So yeah, this is pretty.
It's pretty complicated for the like the personal emails, but.

Bryan Wolf   27:26
Yeah, it is.
They make it really complicated.

Lem   27:29
Yeah, but for yeah. For the business emails or like the? Yeah, it's pretty straightforward so.
The issue here only is for like the personal, so I'm also using my personal e-mail for like testing purposes like if I'm building.
Like same like the same same as like this one.
So I'm just using my like personal e-mail for like building this stuff.
So yeah, it would also be very useful if you can like just connect your e-mail also.
So to make your yeah to use the Google Google's modules because it will be the same on the like the Google Sheets and then also like the Google Drive.
So they also have, if you will, we will use like the Google Drive, it will be the same. We need the scope for that one.
So we could just adjust the scopes here on the APIs and then.
On the APIs and then on the library this one. So we have you can just search here for let's say the Google sheet.
Say Google sheet if you need to connect to Google sheet.
So this one so and then we can we can just like enable this one?
So enable this one then.
Let's say we need also to connect to Google Drive.
So we will just.

Bryan Wolf   28:55
Book.

Lem   28:56
Also search for Google Drive on the library.
So yeah, as you can see, these are the. If we go to the Enable API so.
We have the.
Let me just go back to.
This one's AP is and then.
Library. So let's say Google Drive.
2 wheel drive.
So this one so Google Drive API.
So enable. So now we can connect now to the Google Drive API.
So basically these are just like connecting the APIs of the like the Google products.
So let's say for the like, what are the product other products of Google Drive like Gmail?
Google Sheets.
Google Docs, Google Drive.
Something like that.
So.
Yep.
And then.
Yep, so.
Nicholas, have you tested this scenario?
Did you also have like a open AI and also like a perplexity account or?

Nicholas Westburg   30:23
I do so I I got called up yesterday with with work and just messing around the Google cloud kind of drained me out but I I did have it set up.

Lem   30:26
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   30:32
I have perplexity API credits and then I'm utilizing the Gemini credits via the Google Cloud, so I know there's the vertex option and the Gemini.

Lem   30:36
OK.
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   30:45
I don't have any Openai credits right now, so I just. I'm gonna. I'm gonna mess around with it more and try to get the flow going.

Lem   30:49
OK.
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   30:54
Either with vertex or with Gemini.

Lem   30:54
Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   30:57
Alright.

Lem   30:58
Actually you can also like use Gemini.
Here you can just like change the like all the ChatGPT modules.
Here you can just change it to Gemini if you want.
And that, yeah, yeah. Basically we can put any LLM here and let's say Gemini or like.

Bryan Wolf   31:09
Any LLM there right.

Lem   31:18
I don't know if they have crock here.
Yeah, they also have grok. And then like the other ones.

Nicholas Westburg   31:23
Do they have the local models like llama and whatnot?

Lem   31:27
Local local models for.
Natively in make.

Nicholas Westburg   31:33
Yeah, like Obama, I doubt it. Maybe.

Lem   31:37
Pardon.

Nicholas Westburg   31:38
Oh, like a llama.

Lem   31:38
The.

Nicholas Westburg   31:39
Models like the free and local ones.

Lem   31:40
Oh that, yeah.
So make doesn't have actually their own LLM. Model for now.
So they basically they're we can use like the other.
Llm models yeah EA models.
But yeah, I think for I haven't like used it yet also yet. But if you're familiar with hugging face so we can also use like the.

Nicholas Westburg   32:00
Yeah.
Oh, that's great.

Lem   32:06
Yeah, yeah. Hugging face.
So hugging face has like a free AI models. Also, if you like research it.
They're also like free AA models.
There, that doesn't need credit.
So you can actually like use this one also here on the.
And like experiment on it if you want. Yeah. But basically hugging face also has like video creation photo creation.
So they're yeah, it's pretty extensive right in there.
So yeah, we can also use it here and then Yep.
So for this one, actually this like only a pretty simple, very straightforward use case.
But yeah, you can like play around here with the chat ChatGPT.
Also, right now is capable of building an or like creating an image.
So actually, yeah, it's pretty good on creating like a like a like for marketing purposes or let's say anything you want.
So yeah, you can like play around on it.
So the the main thing here is if you like.
Like get the only the like the basic on how to like set up the.
Modules like like for example the open AI then like set up the your account here.
So basically you can like do anything or any use case that you want.
Yep. So that's just the important part on the like the on the automation side and also like connecting APIs for example this one like.
HTTP request module is used in usually on.

Bryan Wolf   33:51
Hey. So how are you?
How are you putting that #2 result in there for the URL when you just click on the URL section for for a redirect, not for redirect the redirect.

Lem   33:57
This one.
Oh, this one? Yeah. Oh, OK, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   34:01
Yeah. So right there that that comes in automatically when you click URL or you have to like pull that up yourself.

Lem   34:06
Yeah, yeah, this comes automatically.
So if we click like the URL.

Bryan Wolf   34:08
Yeah.

Lem   34:10
So this is like empty right?
So if you click the URL, this one will pop up so we can map just map based on where we want to get the data.

Bryan Wolf   34:12
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem   34:22
So this red.

Bryan Wolf   34:22
Right.

Lem   34:23
Yeah, this red is coming from like this one Gmail.
So what?

Bryan Wolf   34:26
Yeah.

Lem   34:28
Yeah. So we want the data coming from the.
This ChatGPT right?
So this is one yeah.
Then yeah, this one is the result.
So I just you can like just drag and drop here or like just click it.
Yeah. So basically just that's how it's done and then?
Yep. So yeah.
Any questions guys or or?

Bryan Wolf   34:52
That's pretty good. So are you.

Lem   34:54
Yeah, yeah. For this particular workflow, the main thing here is the Gmail.
So this this is like the connecting the account.
Is the main challenge here, but basically after that one this is like pretty straightforward.

Bryan Wolf   35:07
OK.
Yeah.

Lem   35:10
Yeah, the prompts here are pretty simple.
Yeah. And then, yeah, we can.
From there you can go like actually depending on the use case, yeah you can like do the prompts as complicated as you want.
Then you can actually like do it on put the result.
As multiple results.
So we can actually.
Prompt Chat GP ChatGPT to like.
Output multiple results.
So like for example this one is using like the extract the title right and then this also is extracting the summary. But actually we can like build this one only on one ChatGPT so it can like yeah yeah like extract the title in the summary and then.

Bryan Wolf   35:46
Uh huh.
I combine them.

Lem   35:55
Output is.
Output it on the in Jason format.

Bryan Wolf   35:59
So what do you set that up in the description or when you so I know like when you click it you give it like a a job. When you recreate a new module.

Lem   36:03
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yes. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   36:11
So you're just doing that in the description and then since it says in the description and it knows what to do or because I know when you create a new module, it's like you like for open AI it, it has like messages assistant create a completion transform struct.

Lem   36:16
Yes.

Bryan Wolf   36:25
So we don't have to worry about that because you already have it set up to extract.
A summary, but it won't.

Lem   36:29
Yeah. Yeah, that's.

Bryan Wolf   36:30
It won't get like, you know, overwhelmed with, you know, one or two or three tasks.

Lem   36:35
Yep. And also actually like ChatGPT has different modules here. So for example.
We like click this one.
Let me just like.
Let's say this one.
So actually we also have like this different.

Bryan Wolf   36:53
See now what did.
What did you just do there? Where you moved the the timer down to that module?
What does that do?
Like the clock? Yeah.

Lem   36:59
Yeah, yeah, basically, this is like just a trigger. So I've moved it there because if we like, I put the like a ChatGPT module here, then yeah, this will error out because it needs to be connected to the the.

Bryan Wolf   37:07
Mm hmm.
'Cause, it's just a loan. OK. OK. Yeah.

Lem   37:14
Yeah, yeah.
So I just move it here so that we can like open this one. So for testing purposes or something. Yeah. So but yeah, actually I can like also do it here like.

Bryan Wolf   37:18
Yeah.

Lem   37:26
For like testing so so that we can. So I'll be seeing my point is.

Bryan Wolf   37:28
Yeah.

Lem   37:31
I want to like show you that there is also like different modules here like for this example this one so analyze images so we can actually analyze the image and let depending on the use case like for example like. If this PDF so it can like transcribe the.
The text on the PDF then like this one is like generate an image.
So like edit an image, create a translation.
So this one translates an audio to to.
To English and on a text.
So from an audio to a text and also like a transcription from audio text this one.
So yeah, so basically you can do many things using ChatGPT.
And yeah, for ChatGPT on make it.
It's pretty expensive, but like for perplexity or other a I AI models it's not really. For example for growth.
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty limited.
So as you can see, we can like only transcribe, translate, analyze image but.

Bryan Wolf   38:30
Is so is that even the same grok 'cause?
Isn't it GR OK?

Lem   38:34
Yeah, this is a different group.
The one from Elon Musk is. Yeah, it's a different.

Bryan Wolf   38:38
But it's still, yeah.

Lem   38:43
Group from because group from Elon Musk is GR OK, right?
Yeah, we don't have it here.

Bryan Wolf   38:50
Yeah.

Lem   38:52
So this is a different group and yeah, basically we can.
Yeah, we can do do.
Lots of lots of stuff here.
And yeah, but you guys think on the?

Bryan Wolf   39:04
Great. It's great. It's great.
I was just a little confused about the Gmail stuff and then I I think like going from each module to module like to fine tune information that you have in there like some of the like whenever you click on anything where it says like you know set the.

Lem   39:09
Yeah.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   39:19
Number whatever.
Like that small little information I think seeing because these are recorded. So when I go back and try this myself, you know I'll be able to get it done, no problem.

Lem   39:27
Yeah.
And actually we you can.
We can actually like change this trigger if you like.
If you want like let's say.

Bryan Wolf   39:34
It could be any other e-mail account, right?

Lem   39:38
Yeah. And also like we can change the trigger.
Which is it won't be coming from an inbox, let's say.
Let's say we would take the article and let's say like send it on a telegram or on like a WhatsApp or something. So or on a Google sheet, even in a Google sheet.
So yeah, we can experiment with that. Whatever you.

Bryan Wolf   39:58
What other types of triggers?
What other types of triggers could we do?
So let's say you're saying Telegram.

Lem   40:03
Yeah, you can do it via telegram, let's say whenever you like, receive a message from Telegram or like just yourself and then.

Bryan Wolf   40:13
Did it trigger it from like a custom GPT, right?
Can't do that.
Like if I went to a custom GPT and yeah, so we can't do that, OK.

Lem   40:19
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, actually we can.
Yeah, we can do that on here on meet. But actually that is possible.
But it is on a different platform, like on any no.

Bryan Wolf   40:30
Well, I'd I'm happy or something.

Lem   40:32
On any end.
So they already have the AI agent.

Bryan Wolf   40:36
N.
8 N.

Lem   40:37
Yeah, the N8 N.

Bryan Wolf   40:39
OK.
Yeah, I heard about that yesterday.

Lem   40:40
Yep. So the N8 N they they specialize on EA agents.
As for now, so basically you can like chat on like your personal assistant. So and it's also.

Bryan Wolf   40:51
Yeah.

Lem   40:52
So using like ChatGPT or whatever AA models.

Bryan Wolf   40:56
So can I build the same workflow process on there and have the trigger set up to be my custom GPT and then I would just put that. So now in the custom GPT, when I just put like the API for make into my.

Lem   41:06
Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   41:15
Action or how would I?
How would I make that connection? Do you know?

Lem   41:20
For the come again. What what?

Bryan Wolf   41:23
For the trigger so.
For the trigger.
So instead of Gmail as the trigger, I want my trigger to be a custom GPT that I can type into the information and have it extract it.

Lem   41:25
OK.
Yep.
Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   41:37
And so, is that possible?
On on any then.

Lem   41:39
Yes. On anything, yeah, it's possible.
Basically you can chat on your bot there on your a a agent.

Bryan Wolf   41:42
Sure.

Lem   41:46
Then you can like obviously what will happen is.
I can like.
Show you in the.
Whimsical. So basically it's something like let's say.
You have like something that trigger right? So.

Bryan Wolf   42:07
Yeah.

Lem   42:08
Yeah, let's say you have a.
You have API agent here.
So this AI agent has like a chat box.
And you can.
Like you can converse with this particular agent.
So this is just also using ChatGPT or like other llms.
But yeah, usually it's much better to use chat GP for now and then.

Bryan Wolf   42:33
Right. But I I could be in ChatGPT in my custom GPT and give it a give it a give.

Nicholas Westburg   42:39
Hey guys. I gotta run, Glenn.
Thank you so much.

Lem   42:42
OK, K.

Nicholas Westburg   42:42
Have a great weekend.

Lem   42:43
No problem. OK.

Bryan Wolf   42:44
Yeah.

Lem   42:45
Yeah, you too, man. OK.

Bryan Wolf   42:47
So so lamsha if I'm in my.
Gpt, right?
My custom GPT I there's a way that I can give the command in there like you know OK OK.

Lem   42:53
OK.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   42:58
So how do I connect it from there to here though?
Is there I use the API from whimsical or or?

Lem   43:07
I don't know.
I know this whimsical is just for presentation purposes.

Bryan Wolf   43:11
Example, OK, yeah.

Lem   43:12
Yeah, I I wanted to also show you.
So let's say this is like the AI agent that we've built on any 10. And then what?

Bryan Wolf   43:18
Uh huh.

Lem   43:19
Yeah, what we'll do here is we will connect it to tools.
So let's say we will connect it to Google sheet and then.

Bryan Wolf   43:25
So we had. So when you say an AI agent.
In Nan, the AI agent is what exactly? Like what?
What does that exactly mean? AI agent?
That's like you're talking about.
That's the ChatGPT. Or like the crock. Or. OK, OK.

Lem   43:39
Yeah, basically this is like you're talking to a ChatGPT and then, yeah, your own ChatGPT.

Bryan Wolf   43:43
My ChatGPT right, OK.

Lem   43:46
Yeah, basically, that's your your own ChatGPT. And then depending on the context on the prompt so you can like put different identities there.

Bryan Wolf   43:49
Mm hmm.

Lem   43:55
Like, it's like your personal assistant.
Or maybe it's like a like a personal depending on the.
Yeah, depending on the use case.

Bryan Wolf   44:03
Uh huh.

Lem   44:04
But basically, for example, for this particular use case.
So like this one?
So basically we're like extracting the like the link and then researching, right?
So basically what will happen here is we will connect it to our Google sheet, our Gmail and also our, let's say perplexity.

Bryan Wolf   44:21
Yeah.

Lem   44:21
So these are like tools tools on.
On any time.
So basically anything also has this particular modules there.
So what will happen is.
The AA agent will go to the particular tool and depending on the on your message so it will like understand what do you mean and then it will go let's say create check my inbox and if there's like a research article there and then it will go to.
The Gmail and then check your inbox and then it will let's say.

Bryan Wolf   44:51
Hmm.

Lem   44:55
Yeah, this is like the article that came from your inbox.
It will reply something like that and then OK search perplexity for this particular article and then it will go to perplexity.

Bryan Wolf   44:59
Yeah.

Lem   45:04
Yeah, so this is possible on on any ten, yeah, on any tenant it will like, yeah. So it would be a different process compared to this on make.com.

Bryan Wolf   45:08
And it yeah.

Lem   45:18
So it would be like a yeah.

Bryan Wolf   45:19
How so?
Just 'cause, it looks differently on NNN or or or why?

Lem   45:24
Yeah, it looks different.
And then mostly the you need to like manually connect like the tools because they have like a limited limited.

Bryan Wolf   45:35
Manually do you mean like by JSON like like that?

Lem   45:38
Yeah, like, yeah, no, I like the request like this one.
So for example, this is like just connecting to particular particular platform.
So what will happen on if you're like using like the the like the famous ones like the Google sheet or something like like Gmail, so it's already.

Bryan Wolf   46:00
Yeah.

Lem   46:01
There in and. Yeah, but The thing is, it's only limited.
Like they have like only couple of 100 platforms there.
Compared to like me.

Bryan Wolf   46:09
Where there's only a couple 100 on any non.

Lem   46:12
Yep. So yeah, basically if the platform is not is not available there. So we will need to make an HTTP request and then?

Bryan Wolf   46:24
Our self, OK, yeah.

Lem   46:25
Yeah, ourselves.
So we would need to like read the.

Bryan Wolf   46:28
It's much more labor intensive.

Lem   46:30
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
So we would need to like read the API documentation and then yeah, there's like a next step, next steps there so.

Bryan Wolf   46:38
So it's almost not even worth it really.

Lem   46:40
Yeah, compared to like this one.
So we already have.

Bryan Wolf   46:42
Make it's much easier, yeah.

Lem   46:43
Yeah, it's already like built in on the platform.

Bryan Wolf   46:47
Uh, huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   46:48
Yeah.
But basically that is yeah, that is possible.
Just. Yeah, on a different. Yeah, much different complex way. That's right.

Bryan Wolf   46:56
Platform.
Yeah.
OK.

Lem   47:02
Yep.
And.
Yes, so.
Oh yeah, I think that's it and.

Bryan Wolf   47:08
I think that's good.
It was good, yeah.

Lem   47:11
Yeah. So maybe can guys if you're little confused, you'll just like.

Bryan Wolf   47:17
All those directions I think you did a good job of explaining it and you know this is recorded so that if I am a little lost, I can just go back and and and watch the recording and see you do it. And I think it'll be OK and.

Lem   47:17
Yeah, just do this.
Yeah, step by step.
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   47:32
Nick had said that Nick had got through actually just by, you know, constantly screenshotting what was on his screen and sending it to Klitsana, and Claude would give it directions. And he eventually got through. So.

Lem   47:45
OK.

Bryan Wolf   47:45
I think I think I'll be OK.
Back, you know.

Lem   47:48
OK.
Yeah, that's good to hear. But yeah, this pretty yeah, pretty annoying.
The the personal Gmail stuff on, but basically we can like use a different trigger here on like the next maybe.

Bryan Wolf   47:59
Yeah.
I think that's on the next workflow.
I would like to just let you something different entirely. Like I like the WhatsApp idea or something like that, you know.

Lem   48:07
On, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, basically.
Yeah, actually we can like use different triggers.
And yeah, that only also the main thing here on especially on this particular workflows that are using AI model.
So there's like the prompting.
So this is like a different skill also like the prompt engineering, if you heard of it.

Bryan Wolf   48:31
Mm hmm.

Lem   48:35
So basically for this one, it's just like pretty simple, right?
Right, because the task is also a bit simple but direct.

Bryan Wolf   48:40
Very direct, very direct, simple, yeah.

Lem   48:43
But there are like depending on the use case, this would like take like several thousands of words like it's like very long, very long because of like qualifications and like lead scoring depending on the use case.

Bryan Wolf   48:50
Yeah.
Uh.

Lem   48:57
So they are like a certain criteria.
So for now ChatGPT is intelligent enough to yeah to understand, like the whole context of the prompt.

Bryan Wolf   49:03
Yeah.

Lem   49:07
So but it will.
Of course it will matter on the how you prompt it, so how?
How you like?
It like engineered the prompt. The rules like the that's not.

Bryan Wolf   49:15
Would you say ChatGPT is the best at that?
Like that or it gets caught up sometimes on some bigger, bigger processes, bigger workflows.

Lem   49:23
Yeah. Yeah, personally, for me chat GPD is has for now the best.
EA models, especially on like, yeah, on the task side, like if you want to like get some like extra or something like especially on the creating creating contents. Let's say you want to like send a personal e-mail or like send yeah Create an e-mail or like create like.

Bryan Wolf   49:30
That's what you like to use, yeah.
Yeah.

Lem   49:49
An like also like an article or something.
So yeah, chat GT is very good at that.
At the moment.

Bryan Wolf   49:54
Now I have a question.
I have a question.
So could is there with this?
I don't if LinkedIn has the it's you're not able to be connected to make, but there's a way that I can make a a work process flow.
For like a trigger like Gmail or you know whatever it is I send myself an article that I like and then it does all this.
Unless it sends it to my LinkedIn.
Post on LinkedIn for me.
Is that possible or I would just Linkedin's like little weird. I'd have to directly go through and post it myself.

Lem   50:20
Yep.
Yeah, actually we can like directly post it on LinkedIn.
So yeah, it's it's possible because right now we actually have.

Bryan Wolf   50:29
Mm hmm.
So we can like automate a post for me if I sent an interesting. OK. Yeah, OK, I see.

Lem   50:38
Yeah. So we actually have like create a.

Bryan Wolf   50:39
Oh great, yeah.

Lem   50:43
Yeah, create the post.
Yeah, this one's create a user type or create a user image post, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   50:46
Yeah. Awesome.
That's great.

Lem   50:50
So for the draft, because like Peter wants also to like for the next week's flow to create just a draft.
So it's not here.
So I would need to, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   50:58
A draft for what?
A draft for this for for posted on LinkedIn. OK, great.

Lem   51:03
Yes. So like a draft for the LinkedIn.
So yeah, yeah, for unfortunately, it's not here.

Bryan Wolf   51:07
Oh, awesome.

Lem   51:09
So it I would need to like read the documentation then.
Like set up HTTP manual HTTP request for that.

Bryan Wolf   51:18
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, alright, great.

Lem   51:20
But yeah, it's actually it's possible on here like posting on Facebook, Instagram.

Bryan Wolf   51:24
Awesome.

Lem   51:28
Like, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   51:29
Now, Lem, do you do you use any of your own like work for process automations like do you have one for posting on Facebook, Post you on YouTube, do you do you know utilize these a lot or no not really just for work.

Lem   51:42
For now, yeah, I'm. I'm just focusing for now on on like building automations for other people, but I'm also planning build an agency in the future, maybe like like a few months from now. And then yeah, I will start like posting.

Bryan Wolf   51:48
Yeah, yeah.
Uh.

Lem   51:57
On like automation stuff on LinkedIn, something like that on also YouTube or yeah, because yeah automation right now is very like lucrative. And there's like a very.

Bryan Wolf   51:59
Yeah.
Yeah, I feel like on YouTube a lot of people are like 15 processed automations or workflow automations. You can sell the companies right now and they make, you know, decent money off it.

Lem   52:17
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   52:18
Lem, what's your do you have LinkedIn?

Lem   52:21
Yeah, I love. I have LinkedIn.
So you can search I think.
My name it.
Limo John Kim also so.

Bryan Wolf   52:32
You want to type down the chat 'cause there's no way I'm going to be able to.
There's no way I do.

Lem   52:36
Yeah, I'll just send it here on the chat.

Bryan Wolf   52:39
OK, cool.

Lem   52:41
Yeah, you can add me on LinkedIn.
Yeah, I think my name there's.

Bryan Wolf   52:45
Oh, OK.
That's easy.

Lem   52:47
This one.
Yep. So how how old are you guys?
You're like, thinking pretty, oh, 26.

Bryan Wolf   52:58
2611 How are you?

Lem   53:00
I'm 32 right now.

Bryan Wolf   53:02
Virtual. I don't know if this is Peter Junior in here.
Nick Nick is 25.
And Peter Wolf junior is 29, I think.

Lem   53:18
Oh, I see.
Yeah, a pretty young.
Pretty young.

Bryan Wolf   53:22
No, no, I feel old, man.
I feel old man.
I feel old.
You're still young. I thought you were.

Lem   53:27
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   53:28
I I you look young man.

Lem   53:30
Oh yeah, that. Thanks. Thanks.

Bryan Wolf   53:32
Yeah.

Lem   53:33
Yeah, don't look at 30s.

Bryan Wolf   53:36
No, not at all, dude.
I thought you were.
I thought you were younger than me.
I thought you were younger.
Yes, like **** this guy. So much more advanced than I am.
And he's he's like, you know, way younger than me.
I was behind the curve, but yeah, that's good now.

Lem   53:48
Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   53:48
Yeah, Nick's 25.
I'm 26 and P Junior's 29. I think he just turned 29.

Lem   53:54
Yeah.
Yes you did.
You guys are starting to learn this also because for me also like I started like last year on like the automation side cause yeah, so I'm like really when I was like exposed to this one, I really like saw the opportunity.

Bryan Wolf   54:04
Oh really?
Only just a year you've been on this.

Lem   54:14
So I wanted to like, yeah, I wanted to 1st like build it build, build this stuff for other people first before I like that my own.

Bryan Wolf   54:14
You really liked it? Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   54:21
I like business or agency or stuff.

Bryan Wolf   54:23
So you've been aggressive?

Lem   54:23
But yeah this.

Bryan Wolf   54:24
You think you've been pretty aggressive with all those?

Lem   54:26
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I want to one thing so.

Bryan Wolf   54:29
So.

Lem   54:32
But yeah.

Bryan Wolf   54:32
So only a year.
That's pretty crazy.
Wow. So were you self-taught or were you just you'd watch YouTube videos day after day after day?

Lem   54:41
Yeah, I've I've actually like.

Bryan Wolf   54:43
Or did you have? Did you have like your own mentor, like a friend who is advanced at this?

Lem   54:46
Yeah, I don't, I don't know.
No, no, actually I just joined like some of the like the communities on school. If you're school.com, then mostly South Park.

Bryan Wolf   54:55
School.com.

Lem   54:58
Yeah, on school.

Bryan Wolf   54:59
OK.

Lem   55:00
SKOL and then.

Bryan Wolf   55:02
SKOL.

Lem   55:03
There's like automation, AI, automation communities there and then some are like paid, but they're also like free, free free like free.

Bryan Wolf   55:13
Programs. Yeah. Free free, free courses.

Lem   55:14
Yeah, free communities.
Then Yep, basically that's it and.

Bryan Wolf   55:20
Bye.

Lem   55:20
Yeah, just like learning stuff then actually make also us their own like program on on like training program. They also have then I think for Zapier. I think Zapier doesn't have their like whole program for them.

Bryan Wolf   55:35
So you so this you're talking about AI automation candidates at school?
I'm looking at it right now, it's.

Lem   55:40
Yeah, yeah.
AI automation like communities groups.
So it's like, yeah, yeah, it's like a communities of other are like paid.

Bryan Wolf   55:44
Mm hmm.

Lem   55:50
There's like paid groups and then also there's like stuff. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   55:52
Yeah.

Lem   55:55
And yeah, this can then lots of YouTube tutorials like yeah, we can like learn lots of stuff on YouTube right now.

Bryan Wolf   56:02
Yeah, I've been trying.
I've been trying to soak up a lot of information on YouTube.
There's there's a couple creators.
I like that are really good at taking things slow and you know, show you exactly step by step by step by step by step, what to do.

Lem   56:10
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   56:14
This is great.

Lem   56:14
Yeah, that's right.
And.

Bryan Wolf   56:17
Oh, see, that was good though.
See that was good though.

Lem   56:20
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   56:21
So what will you be back Monday or?

Lem   56:25
Yeah, on Monday, I think I also I will start building like the other flow because Peter also.

Bryan Wolf   56:31
That LinkedIn flow.

Lem   56:33
Yeah, the LinkedIn flow.
Yeah. So I would start scope that because there's like other parts that on there that I haven't used yet, like the art that.

Bryan Wolf   56:34
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem   56:45
Philly, like I think it's the Philly RSS feed something. So I would like, yeah, I would read that like the documentation stuff. But Yep, that is.

Bryan Wolf   56:48
OK.
Hmm.

Lem   56:54
For the link in, yeah, that's doable.
And that system can be built here just in make.com, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   57:00
Nice. I'm excited. I'm excited, man.
