Hey, guys.

Lem Quimpo   0:09
Hi, guys.

Bryan Wolf   0:12
Morning, morning.

Lem Quimpo   0:12
Morning.

Peter Wolf Jr   0:13
Good morning, gentlemen.

Lem Quimpo   0:14
Morning.

Nicholas Westburg   0:18
Peter Wolf Junior, Good morning.

Peter Wolf Jr   0:23
What's up? What's up? What's up?

Lem Quimpo   0:26
So.

Bryan Wolf   0:29
Let me know as your weekend.

Lem Quimpo   0:31
Yeah, all good. Didn't really go out because I was a little bit under the weather, so yeah.

Bryan Wolf   0:32
Yeah.
Oh no, I thought you had a birthday.

Lem Quimpo   0:46
Yeah, on Saturday, but uh.
Just went on beet in the restaurant, so.

Peter Wolf Jr   0:51
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   0:55
Nice.

Nicholas Westburg   0:55
Then do you live near the beach to the water?

Lem Quimpo   0:56
Oh.
Not, not really, but maybe 13 minutes to one hour travel to the beach like white sand.

Nicholas Westburg   1:11
Nice.

Peter Wolf   1:19
Ma'am, you going on a vacation or something?

Lem Quimpo   1:22
Uh, no, not really.

Peter Wolf   1:24
Oh, sorry, you say the white sand. I figured you were going somewhere.

Bryan Wolf   1:25
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:29
Oh yeah, they ask if I'm living near the beach, so.

Peter Wolf   1:39
So I just asked Jill to join. I'm reaching out. I don't know if Bart was going to join. I'm gonna ask him to join as well.

Lem Quimpo   1:40
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:46
Mm-hmm.

Gilles Gilmart   1:47
Everyone, good morning.

Nicholas Westburg   1:49
Morning.

Bryan Wolf   1:50
Morning, Joe.

Peter Wolf   1:50
Hey.

Gilles Gilmart   1:50
You know.

Lem Quimpo   1:53
Morning.

Peter Wolf   2:16
Just give another minute. I just pinged the bar.

Gilles Gilmart   2:25
Nika, I mean, I saw your e-mail to Bart about like the integration with Microsoft Azure, right? That's you were you had a technical issue, no?

Nicholas Westburg   2:36
Yeah, just just getting access.

Gilles Gilmart   2:39
Getting access to to Microsoft Azure In In the server.

Nicholas Westburg   2:43
I'm not, yeah, I'm not sure if it's Azure or just getting access to the Microsoft Graph API. I had the same same issues with Akishore well and they I just couldn't get access to it, so I'm not sure if there's a a way to.

Gilles Gilmart   2:51
Oh.

Nicholas Westburg   2:58
Do that or.

Peter Wolf   3:00
I I think we need to, yeah, I think we need to talk about what this is a little bit more. I need to better understand it and so that I I know because if it goes to somebody and we're asking for this kind of an outside API connection into our.

Gilles Gilmart   3:00
I'm asking because.

Peter Wolf   3:15
Outlook or into our Microsoft environment, I know there's going to be pushback on that. So if we're saying that we're staying within our environment and we're saying that you know the Microsoft copilot or something is going to connect In In the kind of again Azure environment into our Outlook, that's no big deal, but to say we're going to go.
They have an API that's going to be external or through our firewall. I think that's problematic. So can we come back to that In a minute? I see Bart.

Nicholas Westburg   3:41
Yeah, Yep.

Gilles Gilmart   3:42
Yeah, because I've got some talk to share about that. I've come across that as well and I use a workaround.

Peter Wolf   3:49
Yeah, so um.
All right. So let's, let's kind of, oh, let's see where we are just In In general, right. We're seven weeks In to this and my view and actually can you, Brian, do you have the spreadsheet that Lim put together with the list of our process flows?

Bryan Wolf   4:11
Oh, I don't. I have the process. I don't remember.

Peter Wolf   4:17
Lem just sent the list on what was it last week, right? Or Lem, can you pull them up? So we, you know In In the In the seven weeks that we've been doing this, we've been focused on the process flow automations trying to work on the outside world, outside.

Bryan Wolf   4:22
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   4:37
Outside of the Microsoft environment to get US, rolling on these process flows and to acclimate US, to what we can do and then with the expectation we're gonna move this now inside.
Of the Microsoft environment and I do have job posting out there and I think I have some pretty good prospects for for bringing someone in. I got to interview these people, but I'm In pretty good shape for for that. I have the the cameras on.
So, so I expect that I can have somebody In the next, hopefully the next day or so that we could start to move these these flows into our environment. Now I had thought about setting up.
So let me start this way. There's there's I I I have no expectation this person's going to get access to our Microsoft environment because Security issues and all that kind of stuff. There's no way I'm going to be able to give that person access. So I was thinking.
You know the two approaches that are realistic is one that we have meetings on a daily basis like you're having with Lim couple hours a day and we that person just works with the with the interns or anybody on our Team In taking those process flows and redefining them into the Microsoft environment.
And where they wouldn't have access and the only, you know, the only value we'd be getting is the acceleration of them working side by side with us. We know how difficult this is because we've done it for clients before and it's a ****** way to go about building stuff. It's not efficient at all.
But it may be the best we have. The alternative is that we can create our own Microsoft environment. You essentially can get that with the Microsoft 365, which I have, you know, outside.
Set up license that you can. I don't even think it costs you more. Or maybe it's, you know, 10 bucks or something a month that you can get full environment with Microsoft Copilot and Power Automate and all those other things. Now you won't have, we wouldn't have the access to the systems.

Lem Quimpo   6:42
Mm.

Peter Wolf   6:57
That is also an advantage to US, being inside our environment like Salesforce and and other functions, other applications that we're going to want to tie into a Zoom info teams or at least teams In our environment. But I was thinking this may still be better.
It may still give US, something more accelerated for that, for that developer or consultant up work resource to accelerate the build right that they could go into that environment and say, OK, well at least I've I've built the whole structure over here.
I've set up whatever we were connecting to API's, they'd be doing the Power Automate, Power Connect and all that kind of stuff and setting a baseline template In that environment and then Brian or Nick or Peter or whatever could be working to put them into our environment.
I mean that's attractive because it does, it does give an opportunity to accelerate getting these into a an environment that is a Microsoft environment. I just don't know how much extra value that's going to bring, especially because it's not going to have the.
The the links to those other apps. And the other thing is right now we're doing calls to ChatGPT, API, Perplexity, Claude. I am expecting that we'll still do.
Those APIs, even though they'll cost US, and even though we have within our environment, we'll have our copilot and they essentially open AI's.
Access to open AI's LLM within our environment. But given our experience, at least what we've seen is the performance is not quite the same. And now also over the last couple of weeks, we've also seen that picking the right.
Engine, the right model actually materially impacts on the success of the process, right? We've picked, we've tried to pick older models or less expensive models to keep the token cost down and we've seen that the performance.
Doesn't isn't nearly the same, right? Does it's not as successful In In following the instructions. So I don't know how much we're going to need to we're going to be able to switch over to leveraging internal versus the external. Now we really need to be moving to internal because again.
Within the pricing structure, we have access to open AI within within the Microsoft environment, which is essentially again Copilot, custom Copilot or Copilot Studio, but we'll have to see how that works, so.
So I'm I'm I'm interested one In what your guys thoughts are on those things to try and bring this over and whether we think that having that that environment, again another environment that's not our serral environment but at least is a Microsoft environment for prototyping these.
These flows.

Peter Wolf Jr   10:06
So I have, yeah, I got a couple points here. First thing I think that we should at least try the second option for like to see the the internals.

Peter Wolf   10:06
Any thoughts or comments?
You're really breaking up, Pete.

Bryan Wolf   10:19
Your connection's so bad. Can't hear you.

Peter Wolf   10:21
Yeah, digital. It's like it's not working. I don't know if you're on ear pods or what.

Peter Wolf Jr   10:22
Hold on.
Can you hear me better now? All right, so my first point here is I think we should run with the second option, at least for the first day or two, right? To see if it makes sense that them building it out in.

Peter Wolf   10:31
Absolutely, 100%.

Gilles Gilmart   10:32
Yes, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   10:32
Yep.

Peter Wolf Jr   10:48
Microsoft Studios and Copilot and everything like that. The process flows would translate to us being able to make an easier transition for them internally if they build out a rough model and then that way they've already done it to a certain degree.

Peter Wolf   11:00
Yeah.

Peter Wolf Jr   11:07
And allowing a little bit more knowledge on their end for us doing it versus because I know some of these flows can take 10 to 12 hours. So that's a lot of time for us. I'd consider maybe doubling it.

Peter Wolf   11:19
To say that we're only achieving it, yeah, we're only achieving it while we're sitting there side by side, right? Because the way we're doing it now, Lem's working the flows at night and we're coming back during the day, we're working through them, talking about them and all. But to think we if we were only restricted to a couple hours a day.
To doing that, that would not be a very fast process, right?

Peter Wolf Jr   11:39
Right. And you got to consider Lem's an expert at doing the flows. So now consider someone trying to who may be an expert at doing them, trying to explain it as it's going through without access, right? Being like, well, first you got to click this and then click that and then a flow takes a week.

Peter Wolf   11:52
Yeah.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf Jr   11:56
Right to do on our end. Um.

Peter Wolf   11:59
Yeah.

Peter Wolf Jr   12:00
And then so I think the best move forward would be to at least for the first flow, have them attempt to build out a rough model in a non connected Microsoft platform and to see if that makes the transition easier for us because we can already see it.
How it's supposed to look?

Peter Wolf   12:19
Yeah, yeah. Then when we're working side by side with him, they can accelerate that. He can be reviewing it, we can be building it over and or when he's not with us, then we at least have the full copy of what he's been able to prototype to bring over. OK, I think.

Peter Wolf Jr   12:32
And then he on meetings, he can troubleshoot any places that were where it's not firing right within our platform.

Peter Wolf   12:40
Yeah.
Yep. So Gilles, any any updated word from from Siddhartha on on anything? I mean, is there anything that's happened since we've had conversations with them? Is there anything that's meaningful to us or?

Gilles Gilmart   12:58
I've been following up every week, but no, I mean only the the fact that the workaround, right, the fact that we can create another environment and share it with the resources, but he has not created that that new secure shared official environment. And Peter, I just wanted to clarify when you when you talk about environment, I'm going to.

Peter Wolf   13:10
Unbelievable.
Yeah.

Gilles Gilmart   13:18
On my screen for a second, you're talking about the the power automate object, right? Talking about this or you're talking about like having a different license?

Peter Wolf   13:24
You know, well, no. First I am talking about that because that's where our issue was, at least the kind of ability to work across apps or whatnot. But no, I meant in an environment, first of all, to create a Microsoft environment that gives us access to Power Automate, Power Connect and and.

Gilles Gilmart   13:31
Right.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   13:44
Copilot studio, but not within our network, right? Because again, getting person access to our network is a problem. I don't know if you guys seen the, you know, the recent stories and it's not just totally recent, but I think there's been some bigger stories that the Koreans, right? North Koreans.

Gilles Gilmart   13:48
OK.

Peter Wolf   14:00
We're going out there getting jobs at these companies as remote workers and then once they're behind the firewall, they're just opening everything up and and yeah, and then hacking the the companies. But so there's no way I'm going to get a developer offshore, no way I won't even risk asking for it. Some guy who I'm going to give access to our network, right?

Gilles Gilmart   14:08
All right. OK.

Peter Wolf   14:20
They want to hire people like that. They'll go through whatever process. But for us right now, that's not going to happen. So I'm trying to find what are the most efficient ways we can move forward, right? So, all right, I'm going to move forward with that model. Yeah, somebody saying something.

Peter Wolf Jr   14:30
I have another question.
Yeah, I did. Where does the IT department and the company stand on using outside LLM to process the information in these flows? You know, is it just we copilot or you know, we find we found that Claude is Claude has worked the best? Yeah.

Peter Wolf   14:40
Yeah, I don't. I don't. I I.
It's problematic. It's problematic. But it it my argument would be depends on the data, right? Right now I'd say they're they're going to be resistant to sending anything out that's going to reach to an outside API for an LLM. But if we're saying that what we're doing is going to Claude to write a blog and we're not putting sensitive data.
Made out there, then I would argue that that's that's an appropriate, you know, non risk, non security risk item. And so we'll have to, we'll have to work those items when we get to it. I don't know how difficult they're going to be, right as you just heard Gilles, it's been.

Gilles Gilmart   15:16
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   15:24
It's been four months that they started this process of of in the Microsoft environment and and really **** has taken place. I mean nothing essentially has taken place and I'm on this strategy steering committee just had a call yes Friday or Thursday.
And that was the first call we had in six weeks. And in the previous call and even the calls before that, I had said, guys, we need a SWAT team, we need a, we need a specific dedicated team that's going to push this forward. And Oliver was like, yeah, we're not going to, we're not going to commit that kind of resources to it. And then now all of a sudden, six weeks later.
He's like, you know what we need is a dedicated SWAT team. I'm like, yeah, OK, great. I love it because HG Capital is really giving them a lot of a tough time that we are not getting visibility to our A I we're not, we're not promoting it. We're not, we're not showing we're A I first. We're not out there in the.

Bartosz Borek   16:08
Um.

Peter Wolf   16:23
The marketplace getting visibility that we are AI first and that's a problem. And so now all of a sudden there's some new invigoration. But but we're we're essentially in my view we're we are plowing forward and other people are you know in the way as opposed to helping us to drive this forward. So we need to push forward as hard as we can.
And whatever barriers we come up against, we'll have to have the arguments for why we want to go a certain path or not. And whether that works or not, I don't know. We'll see when we get there.
Yeah, that's that's it. I'm my intention is to try and utilize those outside applications. Again, clawed, especially if you're talking about writing stuff because that seems to be the best, the best tool for doing that. And I don't think if we have good arguments, I don't think it's going to be a problem.
But then there's the pricing part of it too, right? It's on my dime and and I'm not going to have the company running their, you know, their apps on my dime, but I'm sure we can figure that out as well, OK?

Gilles Gilmart   17:22
And another illustration of that is the Odata services, right? Well, we can't even get a developer access to its internal test systems after multiple meetings, Jira tickets, procurement tickets, very frustrating.

Peter Wolf   17:26
Yep, just unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Yeah.
Yeah, Yep, Yep. So I I I need to have a a follow up. I mean I I did just again the other day, but I didn't bring up the O data service thing and so you sent that e-mail on Friday that you copied me on if we don't get a response.

Gilles Gilmart   17:53
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   17:54
Appropriate response then we will then I'll follow up on it. OK. So the other thing is, and I said this the other day and but Jill, you were out. I believe we have several really good process flows, but they're all just.
Strong prototypes, they're not really there yet. And what I would like to focus on now in the next week, this week is to bring those to fruition, is to get them to where they are strong, workable, usable, fully functioning, production ready solutions.
And my objective is to get the first newsletter out this week on Friday, even if it's going to be more manual than than the fully automated process. I sent down an e-mail last night or this morning.
That that I that I touched on this right. And I I can't remember I I I remember that we went on the path of perplexity and pulling up stories, news articles that way and then we moved away from. But I don't know if it was that we just got you know it was a sideline consideration and then we thought OK the news, the news info reader.
RSS speed is going to satisfy what we need and then we just didn't go that path anymore. But looking at running perplexity with appropriate prompt gets really good results. I mean, if you look at that that list, it was it was like 9 out of 10 and I would say seven out of those ten were great.

Lem Quimpo   19:21
Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   19:27
Right. And nine out of 10 were solid and a couple other things that were in there. It was like Deloitte survey, PWC survey. These are exactly the things we want, right. And so right now looking at that, even just that right there, I would take those and I would, we would have what we need for this week's newsletter, right. So I'm not concerned that if we.
We we can't get the automated feed for all the other stuff or for the news articles working exactly right. But I want to, I want to move now to the point of the focus on the detail, getting these things to where they are functioning appropriately with high quality.
Good output, high quality input, selection criteria, et cetera. And that's really on each of these flows, right? Because I I think the the newsletter is going to be for me right now is the highest priority. I'd like to prove that out. I think it has a lot of moving pieces, so I think it's really good.

Lem Quimpo   20:09
OK.

Peter Wolf   20:25
It's good for, I believe, for the organization. My argument is that every Team should be producing this and getting getting this out In front of clients and it can be customized to their specific areas. Excuse me. So I think, I think this is a strong, sound tool and the other thing for me that it shows and this is one of the arguments.
Was.
Thinking was this whole SWAT Team that needs to be a cross-functional SWAT Team of people committed to identifying that these process flow automations can go across teams, right? So what is this across teams? Well, it's a marketing Team for sure, right? It's the it's the individual product owner teams or consulting teams that are involved because you need people that are specialists in.
In the knowledge concentration In that domain to be able to ensure that the content that's produced or selected is is the most appropriate to, you know, to drive appropriate selection or to to show kind of thought leadership, etcetera.

Gilles Gilmart   21:08
OK.
Um.

Peter Wolf   21:22
So I just think these are, this is a good one. It goes out, it leverages LMS, it leverages process flow automation, leverages, you know, yeah, creation of content, selection and input of content. And I think it's a good one for the interns to be able to also capture and.
You know profile or or yeah to present In their portfolio of things that they achieved. So and I also want it for our Team because I want this to, I want to produce this for our team. So that's a that to me is a high priority and I think when we refine that one then I think that one immediately.
The the things we do to refine that one should immediately be transferable to the single item news article posting for LinkedIn because the the only piece that was really to me was missing was that you know the appropriate blog or appropriate.
Persona right up to to get the output. And it wasn't because I don't think because really all that's all that difficult. Again, it was what persona are we using? And for me, I was tweaking and modifying my persona and the problem is that I.
What I've already said was I kind of over tweaked mine and it started being way too specific and trying to make some stuff up. It was hallucinating a bit and wanted to reference specific clients and customers and stuff like that and that just wasn't working out, but I I think.
The the last version that I just sent to you guys when we were when the other day when I asked Bart to get involved, I think that's pretty straightforward and clean. I just think we need to write the prompt around what it is that the, you know, the, the, the, what's the commentary, what is it that we're trying to achieve In the commentary?
That we're putting into the newsletter. I think that's that's what we need to focus on and I think the the the issue that maybe for me is is one that again once we get into our environment I think how we enhance this further is.
We're going to want to look, we're going to want the LLM to look at what, what have we produced for newsletters past, right. We don't want to make our commentary always sound the same. So I think once we have the newsletter, if we're putting the newsletter, the end result newsletter also gets posted into our.
Into our share folders or whatever and within the Microsoft environment then the Microsoft copilot Will have access to those so it can review what the newsletters, what were they like before and I think to try and ensure some.
Some variety, some some change of of kind of commentary as we go forward. But the first thing is to produce, produce an output. And I I think again with just the articles we got In that e-mail that I sent out last night, I'm fine that we could have three solid articles there, one of them being the Deloitte Survey 2025 survey.
And two other articles, whatever and and or we can also look what has In a reader collected over the last week. Is there anything that's worthwhile out there to see if you know we have alternatives to choose from, but I think that and.
And even just the, for example, the prompt, the one prompt that I created on the currency. So certainly we can try and come up with a different one or any other one. But I think even if we just went with that one for that prompt of the day, I'm fine with that, right? I think it looks robust enough, it seems.

Gilles Gilmart   24:39
Up.

Peter Wolf   24:55
You know it's I I think it's it's it it should based on when I ran it, it should get decent response from the information. I think that shows that there's it gets people identifying ways that they can get more Information out of LLM's without putting In sensitive data right without expecting that they have a.
An LLM behind their behind their firewall that they can utilize, right? Because obviously if they have they have that then they can put sensitive data In there. But with going to an outside just regular natural language processing solution then they can't put that In there.
So that being the case, then I guess I want to ask Bart, can you continue to push forward on the with with Brian and Lem on?

Bartosz Borek   25:53
I sent you a updated prompt on Friday. I don't know if you had a chance to run that yet or.

Lem Quimpo   25:59
Yeah, the yeah, I actually, yeah, that's right. I actually updated the all of the content modules to Claude and then I added your your prompt which is the.

Bartosz Borek   26:02
The one where I was asking, Yep.

Lem Quimpo   26:16
Let me just yeah, I I actually tested out. Let me just share my screen also so that we would have more context.

Bartosz Borek   26:17
Test it out. Was it uh?
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   26:28
OK, so yeah, I added this.
Um, yeah, I think this one is the.
This is the one, right? Yeah. And yeah, so I added it on the like the IN readers, like the the one who is creating the content and then I tested it.

Bartosz Borek   26:38
Yep. Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   26:53
Also here on the OK.

Peter Wolf   26:53
Are we? Can I just ask again, clarification? So what you had there was just a mini blurb. Are we also then still sending, for example, my persona as what's being delivered to the to Claude right there that get persona?

Lem Quimpo   27:03
Yep, that's right. Yeah, the get the persona. So we we still have that one. But yeah, so the output for this one would be of course different depending on the persona, because the persona, as I've said right here, is just a placeholder.

Bryan Wolf   27:05
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   27:09
OK.
Right.
But I'm just asking right now, is the ersona that's In there right now the persona that I have provided with my most recent ersona?

Lem Quimpo   27:24
Yep.
Yep, that's right. This no, no, this is the one that is the placeholder, so I don't have a copy yet with the your your own persona, so you know.

Peter Wolf   27:30
OK.
OK, Brian, can you send that to him? But then Brian, you need to then take this and put this into our environment update with the Claude connections that Lem has provided, right?

Bryan Wolf   27:43
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   27:53
Yep, that's right for all the content. So I've changed them to the to Claude Claude Sonnet 4 and then we have now the like a new system prompt which is the corporate treasury expert and then creating the. So it's just also I want to note that for example like the instructions right.

Bryan Wolf   27:53
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   28:13
Like creating a concise newsletter and then we have here like a write a single paragraph summary. So I'm not sure if that's the like the content that we want to show or if like it's a commentary because the the these are the like the new blurbs coming from perplexity.

Peter Wolf   28:19
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   28:32
So the one that uh is new, so it's actually like kinda like a overview also.

Peter Wolf   28:37
Right. So right now that's a summary, but I think that's where we do want to make it where it's a commentary, summary commentary, right. We want it to have a A twist other than just the the, the summary of the.

Lem Quimpo   28:40
Yep.
Yeah, yeah, good.

Peter Wolf   28:53
Of the content itself. I mean, at least again, talking through with with Claude about what this newsletter, how it should be approached. It was saying, yeah, just putting a summary here really isn't isn't bringing that extra value, right? It's like, why would this matter now? I don't know if trying to do that In 50 words.

Lem Quimpo   28:54
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   29:12
Is really going to be how successful that's going to be, giving some kind of summary at the same time as giving a commentary on it.

Bryan Wolf   29:22
Yes.

Lem Quimpo   29:22
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   29:23
Yeah.
Yeah, This is where I think this is where we need to work on. What is that? What is the prompt look like to get that? And what do we? Yeah, again, from my perspective, it's somehow saying I want a summary that also has a commentary given the the persona and, you know, understanding that we're trying.

Lem Quimpo   29:30
Yep, that's right.

Gilles Gilmart   29:37
Yes.

Peter Wolf   29:43
To intrigue leadership In the Treasury finance space about automations, optimization and transformation, right?

Lem Quimpo   29:53
Yep, Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   29:54
It it may be as simple as writing those words In that instruction there, but I think again having the um.

Lem Quimpo   30:00
Mm.

Bryan Wolf   30:13
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   30:14
Yeah, that's right. We we could also feed here like the sample like the sample blurb that for the so that Claude also would have like an an extra context on what to output because yeah that would also add like some clarity on the if because.

Bryan Wolf   30:14
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   30:32
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   30:33
We need the to also see say it very as specific as we can, right? So that the output would be also what we want. So I think that would also help, yeah, if we could have the like the best like.
What we want to output and then we could show it as an example here for the LLM. Yeah, I think yeah, that would help a lot because yeah, as you can see, although as I already.
Actually coming from perplexity, I've added here like the summary and also the like the relevance. So this is like the expert commentary like the relevance. So it's coming from perplexity but the output for this one.

Peter Wolf   31:17
Well, what does the relevance? What does specifically that mean? Because that's a variable you're saying you're pulling over. What is the relevance coming from?

Lem Quimpo   31:23
Yeah, it's coming from Perplexity, so you can actually check it on the history.

Peter Wolf   31:29
Oh, so relevance is a blurb is a blurb that perplexity is putting out.

Lem Quimpo   31:33
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So I've added there that it would output the summary, the coming from the article, so the title, summary and relevance. So the relevance actually is something like offers something like this, like this is like the summary, right?
And then, uh, this was the title and then offers highly relevant data-driven side. Yep, Yep.

Peter Wolf   31:52
Yeah, no, that's it. That's good right there. I think that's that's setting the stage for the other part. I think that relevance is exactly what we're talking about is trying to come up with what we're trying to put it In context that shows it's relevant to them. Why should they spend their time clinking on this link and reading this article? That's exactly what we want to be doing.

Lem Quimpo   31:59
Yeah, Mr.
Oh.
We would output the relevance. Is that the is that?

Peter Wolf   32:16
No, I'm saying that relevance is essentially what I'm talking about, right? This combination of relevance and summary is that what we're trying to communicate In the blurb is to say, here's a little overview of what this article is and why it matters to you. So the fact that you've incorporated that relevance into an output from.

Lem Quimpo   32:22
Oh, OK. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yep.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   32:36
Complexity. I think that is a exactly the kind of context that we're trying to incorporate into the claw.

Lem Quimpo   32:41
Oh, OK. Yeah, I see. I see. Yeah. So it's like, yeah, we would just need to combine this both, right, like the summary and then add some commentary, I think, based on the relevance. So I think, yeah, Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   32:54
Yeah. Or maybe, again, maybe this is what you feed from you feed from here. Then we that's the output from perplexity. And now you feed both of those, like you said you're doing into Claude and you say, Claude, here's, here's, here's what we have as our relevance and here's what we have as our summary. How do you now write this In a way that's more compelling combining them together?

Lem Quimpo   33:05
Yep, I actually.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   33:14
Into a 50 word blurb that is more compelling that's to this target audience.

Lem Quimpo   33:17
Yep.
Yeah, I think that would be much better. Yeah, that that that specific words because as you can see the instruction also is saying summary here. That's why I think the output is also like summarized. But if we change the wordings here, so yeah, that would be also.

Peter Wolf   33:33
Yep.

Lem Quimpo   33:39
Uh, change the of course, change the output and how it would create the content. So I think uh, the specific word here is very important.

Peter Wolf   33:43
Yeah. So Bart, can we, can we focus on this? Can we focus on that part or I mean that's one of the pieces I'd like you to focus on is taking what we're what we have as the relevance. So I would, I would, what I would do is and I don't know how hard it is to extract, but when you're taking it from perplexity.

Lem Quimpo   33:46
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   34:01
When you're feeding it into the spreadsheet, In the spreadsheet, are you putting In the summary and the relevance into the spreadsheet? Or are you just making out a variable and calling it when you get to plot and then pulling it along but not putting it In the spreadsheet?

Lem Quimpo   34:07
Cool.
No.
Yep, that's right. So yeah, I'm not putting it on the spreadsheet. I'm just feeding it directly to Claude. That's right. So it's coming from, yeah.

Peter Wolf   34:20
Yeah, I'm just, I guess the the the the reason I ask that is because I'm trying to figure out how much clarity Bart can get to what that relevance wording looks like coming out of perplexity, right?

Lem Quimpo   34:31
Oh OK yeah, we could actually feed it also on the like like the Google sheet here. So we could actually add a section here for example like the summary and then the summary relevance and then like the final blurb like the final new subsection.

Peter Wolf   34:47
Let's let's add that In there, right? Because that is visible and we can see, OK, what is, what is, how is perplexity assessing this? But I think the prompt then still comes back to Claude saying here's what perplexity said the relevance is, and here's a summary of the article or not even.

Lem Quimpo   34:49
Yeah, so that.
Yeah.
Yeah, that.

Peter Wolf   35:06
Summary at that point, we're feeding full article to to Claude, right?

Lem Quimpo   35:11
No, just the summary because on our prompt on perplexity we just asking it for the summary and then I've added the priority list of the links here, but we're just searching for the like.
The 10 most, uh, this is coming from your pump right there.

Peter Wolf   35:29
OK, but tell me, go back over to the go back over whether you jump over to the flow or not, but at least thinking about In the one we're reading where we're going from Eno reader, what's the process flow there?

Lem Quimpo   35:40
Yeah, on inner reader. So we're also getting the summary from the inner reader, so not the whole article. And then it's.

Peter Wolf   35:45
Right.
And we don't get it. We don't get a relevance there either, right?

Lem Quimpo   35:52
We we we actually we're getting the expert commentary here from ChatGPT so.

Peter Wolf   35:58
Right. But at that point you're feeding the full article to Chat GT, right? Or no?

Lem Quimpo   36:02
No, but just the summary. Yeah, just the all of the summary is aggregated into one bundle and then we are feeding that one to ChatGPT so that it would choose the top three articles. And then there's like the expert commentary why it chooses it chosen that three particular articles.

Peter Wolf   36:09
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   36:21
Then that's the one that you're.

Peter Wolf   36:21
OK. But so then In that point to make these aligned, I would say you'd also ask you to put this relevance, right?

Lem Quimpo   36:27
Yeah, yeah, we could change the because, uh, yeah, we could add here the relevance and not the.
Expert. Uh, yeah.

Peter Wolf   36:35
That way both of these flows that feed into the spreadsheet are delivering the same content.

Lem Quimpo   36:40
Yeah, that's right. Um.
Yeah, that that like the the final contact would be.
Uh, yeah, we we need that.

Peter Wolf   36:51
No, but I'm saying, look the the choose top three articles. When you do the top three articles, we give, we fed In 100 articles. Let's say maybe it's only 20, but whatever we pick the top three, it creates the summary and now we're going to add In relevance, right? Why is it relevant?

Lem Quimpo   37:00
Yep.

Peter Wolf   37:07
To this, to this target audience and then we're going to and and I guess the problem is we're saying here, we're going to say how's it relevant, but we need to give it context relevant to what we're telling it already that it's a that you're a treasury specialist, right or treasury finance specialist.

Lem Quimpo   37:11
OK, Yep.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, we're already telling it the the identity. So the treasury specialists, something like that. And then, yeah.

Peter Wolf   37:25
OK.
OK, so then so then this output from there would be now three articles with each with a summary, each with a relevance, right? If we add relevance In here, so now they offer you to the spreadsheet. Now we select from the spreadsheet from whatever number it's been five days or three articles from that perplexity.

Lem Quimpo   37:35
Also the so.
Yep, Yep, that's right.
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   37:51
And it also added a handful of articles. And now we're at the point where we select, we go into the spreadsheet, we look at those, we pick the ones we want, three we're gonna include into the newsletter and we trigger now when we trigger at this point.

Lem Quimpo   37:57
Yep.

Peter Wolf   38:07
Um, the full article's never been looked at after this.

Lem Quimpo   38:09
OK.
No, yeah we we're we're not actually looking the full article because though we discussed it on the past that it would like get I mean like spend too much tokens because like an article has like a very long.
Um, like, uh, very.

Peter Wolf   38:32
Well, I knew we, I knew we did that when we were upstream saying we can't do that for 100 articles, right? And I have no idea what this perplexity search is going to end up charging us, right? Given that we're saying do this broad-based search.

Lem Quimpo   38:33
But.
Yep.
Yep. Um.
Oh, you want to like search for like just a single link? Is that what? Or a single article? Or what's the?

Peter Wolf   38:53
No, no, I'm I I'm again, I I want the the search that I gave you earlier. I want to be done. I don't know what that's gonna end up costing if we start doing that on a daily basis. I don't know how many tokens that is.

Lem Quimpo   39:00
Yeah. Oh, OK, yeah. So yeah, the perplexity one is actually not really costing too much. So we could actually check the cost here.
But basically, yeah, it's not really costing a lot.
But if we what I was.
Usage. So yeah, as you can see, it's just like 1351 tokens. So Yep, that's right for the search. Yep, Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   39:36
That's the total tokens for that search and bringing back that output. OK, that's nothing. Perfect.
OK, so then, but but once we get to the point of writing the full article, I don't know that writing the OR not full article. What are we talking about? In this case, we're not writing a long blog or something. We're writing a little tiny relevance.

Lem Quimpo   39:44
So it's.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   39:59
You know summary and so maybe we don't really need to know the whole article that the summary of the article and and kind of just take an interpretation would be enough there.

Lem Quimpo   40:09
Yeah, because uh.

Peter Wolf   40:10
But I guess I I kind of throw this out to you and Bart and Jill. I mean, what are your thoughts on on that or anybody on the call? What are your thoughts on that? Not really assessing the full article if all we're doing is writing A50 word blurb and relevance?
Certainly you can do that on a superficial basis. Do you think that the need to have the full article makes a difference In that? I guess maybe the only way to find out is again is by probing this thing and trying it.

Bartosz Borek   40:38
I think the summary we're probably safe with the summary, but like with the relevance to kind of corporate treasury and corporate finance, I mean maybe that'll be challenging or you know, it might become repetitive.

Peter Wolf   40:53
Without, without assessing, without incorporating the whole article, you mean?

Bartosz Borek   40:55
Yeah, without assessing the full article. Yeah, I.

Peter Wolf   40:58
Yeah, I I I kind of feel like that too, that even if it's only 50 characters, if if we're writing that relevance based on a summary which already is not gonna, it's lost all the nuance right at at 50, 50 words.

Lem Quimpo   41:10
Yeah, no, let me just for the relevance, I think because perplexity has like it's actually researching the articles, right? So the relevance here is actually not based on the summary, but it's actually based on the full article because it's actually searching that.
Particular website, if that that makes sense. But for the yeah, that one, yeah, that that's right. For the eye reader, yeah, isn't. Yeah, that's right. So.

Peter Wolf   41:31
OK, but but the other one, the inno reader, the inno reader isn't.
And and So what? Maybe what we need to do, right? Because here we we choose the top three articles. Maybe at the point we choose the top three articles, we send it and we tell it, tell it, OK, now take the top three articles and actually assess the articles and write the relevance.

Lem Quimpo   41:56
Yeah, we could do that. Yeah. Like we could add a step here, which is perplexity. And then it's like, yeah, basically it would search for the.

Peter Wolf   42:04
Well, when we do it as perplexity, I mean we could use perplexity because then you would have consistency, right? You say, OK, here's the three, here's the three articles now go and and write me the but but at that point then maybe, maybe, yeah, I'm trying to think about what's what's the best methodology here because we're using the.

Lem Quimpo   42:09
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
OK.

Peter Wolf   42:24
ChatGPT there to write a summary, right? Because it it's better than perplexity at writing that summary. Perplexity is better at doing a search, right? And Claude's better than either of them at writing at writing something. So I'm just trying to figure out where's the right spot to to do this. Is it?

Lem Quimpo   42:29
Yeah.
Yep.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   42:41
Is it? I mean, if we're trying to get it to put a relevance there, then it has to see more than the, it has to see more than the summary. It has to see the article, right? And we don't want to put it all the way over at the Claude step because that means the step with the perplexity is different than the one with the Inno reader because.

Lem Quimpo   42:52
Yep.

Peter Wolf   43:01
We're feeding a relevance that actually has taken into consideration more details from the article, whereas the ones coming from inner reader isn't. So we have to put some steps In there and I think there has to be a step. It has to be where we send the three articles or the.

Lem Quimpo   43:08
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   43:17
The links to the three articles. If we send the links, then we're not actually sending the tokens. It does have to go to read them, but we're not sending the tokens and then receiving the tokens back. We're saying here's the link, go develop a a a relevance for me on these.
So maybe going to perplexity and saying here's the links so that we do have consistency with the other with the other flow and now we have relevance coming from from for all of them. It's going into the spreadsheet and then when we feed it to.

Lem Quimpo   43:33
Yep.
Yeah, this one.

Peter Wolf   43:49
To Claude, then it is more. Maybe we should ask for a longer relevance though, to give Claude more context because Claude's not reading the whole article or or or or or. I mean back to what Bart was saying.

Lem Quimpo   43:52
Yep.
Uh, yeah, we could. I think we could.
I did.

Peter Wolf   44:06
Yeah, maybe, maybe this isn't enough. Maybe that the maybe the relevance isn't enough and that really we should just wait. And at the very end we should send all three articles to Claude and say here's the three articles I I chose. Now you should assess all three articles and you should write a commentary slash.
Relevance for each one.
Because then we're feeding the whole article, and Claude is the one that we're saying we're relying on to write the best anyway.

Lem Quimpo   44:31
Yeah.
Yeah, I think we could use perplexity. I'm just yeah, we can try to use perplexity, but if it can't do that one, we could also use like a like a web scraper to search that website and get the particular content.
So like that would get like the whole article and then that would be the one that we feed to the to Claude. So but yeah, I think perplexity would can also.
Just not sure because sometimes it's like if like the article is very long it just outputs it on for example like 6-7 paragraphs so it did it doesn't add the raw like the raw article so.
But yeah, I think it there's some nuance there on perplexity.

Peter Wolf   45:36
Hey, so Barb, what are you? What are your thoughts on this?
I mean, I I don't want to go too too complicated now to maybe we just get some **** working again. I want I want something that's functioning here and maybe I'm shooting too high for for for kind of first draft work.

Gilles Gilmart   45:40
Um.

Bartosz Borek   45:44
It's.
Exactly.
So first question is the summary is gonna be about 50 words, right?

Lem Quimpo   46:01
Yep, yeah, that's right for.

Bartosz Borek   46:01
So.
If we're now adding, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I I think, I think more than that, but but but that's gonna be In the actual newsletter, right? A quick summary.

Peter Wolf   46:03
But that's only because that's what we're setting it. That's what we're setting it for, right? If we were saying, hey, this is a.

Lem Quimpo   46:04
Um.
Yeah, but but for.

Peter Wolf   46:10
Thanks and.

Lem Quimpo   46:10
Yes.

Peter Wolf   46:14
Well, this is, this is, this is what we're trying to refine, right? Originally I was not expecting to have commentary In the newsletter. It was going to be like, here's a summary, but I think giving some kind of relevance slant to that is valuable, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   46:17
Yeah.
Mhm.
Definitely, definitely. However, that said, so we're going to have maybe 50 words on summary and then 20 or 30 words on commentary or relevance to Treasury.

Peter Wolf   46:41
It's going to be, it's going to be too much. That's why I'm saying I think it needs to be combined kind of relevance and summary. The summary that we're getting was really only intended to help Chachin BT make a selection.

Bartosz Borek   46:46
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   46:58
Of the options without having to send full articles for 100 articles because the number of tokens, that's where we went this way, right? Originally we were going getting the full articles, sending full articles and we're like, OK, that's not going to work. We do that every day and we're saying send 50 articles and pick three. Well, I just paid for 50 articles to be sent by token.

Lem Quimpo   47:06
Yep, that's right.

Bartosz Borek   47:18
Yeah, yeah, of course.

Peter Wolf   47:18
Right. So that's why we went to summary. Now that we have summary though that that got US, to our selection criteria. But once we're going to writing this again, maybe it's that we write a longer relevance.
We still don't have the whole article, although if you have the whole article, you're gonna get better content no matter what, right? I I think one's gonna do better if he's got the full article and he tried to write its relevance or.

Bartosz Borek   47:39
Yeah, for sure, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   47:40
Yep.

Peter Wolf   47:46
But In that few characters, I mean, how much can you really, how much is it really gonna be impacted?

Lem Quimpo   47:49
But I think what will happen also Peter when we feed the link to perplexity so it will actually scrape like search that article and then if we if we add to the prompt that it would add a relevance. So what happens is.
It will actually read the whole article and base the relevance from that. So that is actually what you want, right? Because yeah, so because ChatGPT and Perplexity has of course a different would be have different responsibilities here. So the ChatGPT is just choosing the top articles and then it would feed the link.

Peter Wolf   48:13
Right.

Lem Quimpo   48:26
Link to perplexity and then perplexity would search that article on the Internet and it would actually have the full context the same as this one. So it's researching the all the 10 articles, right? And then it's basing actually its relevance.
Comment on that particular full article, so it's if that makes sense.

Peter Wolf   48:45
OK, but but then I think.
If we go this way, I think we should have perplexity write a longer relevance, a longer definition of relevance, so that then if we're not going to feed the whole article the claw, which we'll see how this works out, let's go this path.

Lem Quimpo   48:57
Oh, OK. Yeah. Yeah. Longer. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   49:06
Since we're closer to this than the other, say we we add the perplexity for the inner reader, we we send what we come up with the three coming out of Chat GBD. We send that to perplexity, have it write a relevance again based on our persona, based or based on our target audience.

Lem Quimpo   49:20
Yep.

Peter Wolf   49:25
And and we expand that relevance to, you know, 100 words instead of 50. And then that means we're feeding something more. We're feeding the summary and we're feeding the the, the fuller relevance.
For both inter reader feed and the perplexity feed into Claude at the end and then telling Claude, OK, now you write something that is, let's say, better worded than what perplexity had using.
The Information that's available to you In your broader context of understanding.

Lem Quimpo   50:00
OK.
Yeah, so for the prompt here it could be just the same with the perplexity search and I know reader so that it would be also like uniform, the content would be similar.

Peter Wolf   50:13
Yeah, again, but with expanded relevance, writing the relevance be longer.

Lem Quimpo   50:20
Yeah, we could just adjust the prompt that it would spit out much, yeah, much longer relevance. And yeah, the same also for this one. So I think it would be, yeah, more uniform, like the output for this would be much the same for this one because we're adding like the.
Like the perplexity here and then Claude. So basically that's the from here to here. It's basically the same as you can see. So from here from the iterator to the to the last node. So that's actually the same as here on the Inu reader, so.
Yeah, that's right. It would be much, uh, much similar if we do that route.

Peter Wolf   51:03
So I guess back to the the the question that Bart was raising trying to figure out.
What this section really looks like? Sorry, I just hold on. I just ate a bite of food. Trying to look what this section looks like.

Lem Quimpo   51:13
OK.

Peter Wolf   51:24
Are we, are we going to try and have some theme in that particular set of articles? I think probably not. Maybe down in the in the social media where you're saying, well, hey, this is kind of trending topics or something, but.
In the news article, I don't think it's that we're trying to find a specific consistency of three articles that are have the same, you know, either objective or commentary that we're bringing together to say, oh, these three say one message together.
Right. They're really in isolation, but we want to give a rationale for why this one is important to for someone to read. So I was, I was wondering whether we needed to look at them in context of all three together when we're writing this commentary, but I don't think so.

Lem Quimpo   52:00
Yeah.
Mhm, OK.
Yeah, I think the would the like common grounds of the three articles would be the angle from the identity because we're feeding perplexity the relevance actually this lacks that particular context. So we would.
We need to add here the the relevance, right? Because it doesn't have the context for the relevance. As you've said also a while ago, yeah, we need to add the that particular identity. Yeah, that's right for this one.

Peter Wolf   52:40
Yeah.
Right. What does relevance mean? Well, we're talking specifically relevance to if if it were, if we were saying tell me the relevance to a a, you know, international aid worker rather than the relevance to a financial, you know, leader. So obviously we have to have the context there.

Bartosz Borek   52:55
Yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   52:57
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah. So I think that would be like the the similarities of the three articles.

Peter Wolf   53:06
Right, 'cause they would all be focused on the same market, the same target audience. That part would be consistent.

Lem Quimpo   53:10
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I think like, yeah, yeah. What I'm thinking is the main goal would be like the like the summer or like the blurb here would be something like like the angle on the corporate treasury something and then why it matters on that particular angle. So that would be.
The yeah, the mean mean uh similarities uh.

Peter Wolf   53:33
Yeah, I don't see it as two separate sections though, right? I mean, Bart, you were asking, is it the summary and then another set of words? To me, it's a combined summary at the same time giving the angles like in this article, you know, frigging.

Lem Quimpo   53:38
Oh.

Peter Wolf   53:48
Elon Musk talks about how A I is going to impact on finance, which we think is critical to you because you are in the midst of, you know, in the in the depth of financial requirements and delivering on these things. And this is very apropos to to corporate treasurers or something like that, right. So it's going to be the summary is part of the.
Commentary. I don't see it as here's a summary section and here's why it's relevant. Unless you guys think doing it like that would make sense. Like here's a summary and hey, why does it matter to you?
dot.

Bartosz Borek   54:20
I think Peter, I think personally it should be two sentences. The first sentence a quick summary and the second sentence may be like a little more thorough explanation of why it why it's relevant to our field.
But.

Lem Quimpo   54:37
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   54:38
OK, I I so so your answer is they should be together as opposed to two separate sections where you'd have a header that said summary and a header that said relevance.

Bartosz Borek   54:39
I I don't know that that's just I'm.

Lem Quimpo   54:39
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   54:47
Sure. Yeah, I I think like In this instance that we have on the screen right now, if we like under Redwood, if you just keep it there, like that first instance Will be like, oh, OK, sorry, the first sentence Will be exactly what, you know, the article is about. And then the second sentence, this could be important for Treasury because.

Lem Quimpo   54:55
OK.

Bartosz Borek   55:07
Blah blah blah blah blah and then.

Peter Wolf   55:08
Yeah, so I I I'm, I'm that's no, that's my position too. That's my view. So let's go with that. I want it to be more than one sentence for each of those things, right? So even if it's a kind of two sentences or more one sentence of summary and two sentences of relevance, because a sentence is normally.

Lem Quimpo   55:09
Um, OK, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   55:10
I I don't know that's.
Yeah.
How many words is? How many words is that?

Peter Wolf   55:27
Somewhere around 10 words, right? And we've said we want this to be 50 words, not more than 50 words. Yeah. So I think we should be shooting for that 50 word limit and some combination of of of summary of what it is and of the relevance to to Treasury, so.

Lem Quimpo   55:31
Yeah, around 50 words. Yep, that's right.

Bartosz Borek   55:38
OK. Yeah, that's fine.

Peter Wolf   55:46
OK, where we are, we're going to add In a step for the e-mail reader feed so that it can also include perplexity. And to give it the relevance, we're going to extend the the length of the relevance because it's not big enough that it's going to matter. We're only doing it for three articles, right? Or three articles a day, but we saw.

Lem Quimpo   55:52
Yep.

Peter Wolf   56:06
That that's not really giving US, 1300 tokens for doing the search and coming back for the content is not going to be meaningful. So we'll add that step in, then we'll add into the spreadsheet a column for the relevance. We'll feed all of that to Claude.

Lem Quimpo   56:06
Mhm.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   56:24
The bigger, fuller relevance. And then we'll give Claude again the persona saying now take these, you know these, let's let's make it 100 words or no. What do we, what do we say? What do we have it for right now? The relevance? Do you have some character limit?

Lem Quimpo   56:37
Not really. But it's, yeah, yeah, it's 50. No, I think, yeah, there's no, there's no particular.

Bartosz Borek   56:40
No, it's just 5050, right? Uh.

Peter Wolf   56:44
For for the relevance it is too.
That was just the summary, right?
Limit. I would ask it, I would add, I would tell it to to make the the relevance longer, right? Since we're not feeding the whole article in, I want perplexity to be telling US, why it's relevant to corporate finance, treasury, automation, transformation to that context.

Lem Quimpo   56:54
Yeah, I didn't add.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   57:12
So that then Claude Will have something fuller to consider.

Lem Quimpo   57:17
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, I I think I would. Yeah, we need to update the.

Peter Wolf   57:18
OK. And then hopefully with that relevance and the 50 word summary that Claude should be able to write a 50 word combination that says why it's relevant and and and and without feeding it the whole article.

Lem Quimpo   57:34
Yeah, OK. Yeah, I think that's much more clear now also for me on the like the the content that we want to, yeah, to output here.

Peter Wolf   57:39
OK.
OK, so so right now I think we're we're clear on what we're going to do In the three In the three article section. Where is the, where is the right up at the top? What's the the very intro part? This is done at the very end when it's pulled all together, right when it has the context of the full news article.

Lem Quimpo   57:49
Yeah, clear articles, OK.
Uh, yeah, that.
Yeah, that's right. In the past actually let me just pull it up. So in the past it was actually just feeding the news article and like the other ones here. So what I did now is it updated it to Claude and then I added all of the.
Uh intro, Uh conclusion and also the Uh bullet points in the last part of the flow because.

Peter Wolf   58:25
After it already got everything else together.

Lem Quimpo   58:27
Yeah, that's right. So we are feeding all of the variables or all the sections of the newsletter to them to to create that intersection and also the persona. So yeah, that's right. So the flow would be.

Peter Wolf   58:35
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   58:43
It will pick up all of the data from this one. So the aggregated subsection text, I mean newsletters and then social media AI tool. So all of the newsletter section and then it would create the like the short intro paragraph. Also for the conclusion, yeah the same.

Peter Wolf   58:59
OK, OK. Can we, can we look at?

Lem Quimpo   59:01
That's that one.

Peter Wolf   59:07
So we have the intro, we have the articles. The next section is social media, right? And right now we're having some challenges with the social media part of it as well. I I started to play around because In the response that perplexity gave me.

Lem Quimpo   59:14
Yep.
Um.

Peter Wolf   59:23
When articles, it actually pulled a couple of things from from LinkedIn. And then I thought, OK, well could we do the same search for specifically for social media? And I don't know how well that Will turn out or not because right, we we're not using X.

Lem Quimpo   59:37
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   59:43
Because of the cost, but if perplexity can search X without.

Lem Quimpo   59:45
Yeah, actually I I was also researching about the X, so we we could actually search the like the post, but for particular I think it would be much better if we could just search per profile like.
Specific profile so that it won't be like the randomized like that. The output won't be random because I what I was thinking.

Peter Wolf   1:00:13
You're saying pick pick particular accounts that we want to search or?

Lem Quimpo   1:00:17
Yep, that's right. Yeah, that's right. Like corporate treasury is something like influencer or something like that that posts all every, for example, every week or every other day, something like that. Because what I was thinking in the past is we were searching like just a word. That's why I.
I didn't really pushed on it because for example if we search on Twitter like a corporate treasury, it would spit out like very noise, like too much noise on the posts. But if we go on a route that we would add specific profiles to search for their posts, I think the output would be much better.

Peter Wolf   1:00:57
But I thought In this one we weren't even able to search it because it needed a we needed an enterprise account or something that was going to cost a couple $100 per month or.

Lem Quimpo   1:00:57
So uh.
Yeah, yeah, basically, yeah, because what I was thinking is it we were like scraping the posts on X, but on Appify, they actually have some actors here that are.
Like scraping also per profile. So that's much specific not like because in the past I was thinking that we would like broadly search the whole X right like cool Twitter. So that's why I I was.

Peter Wolf   1:01:36
When you say a profile, are you saying specific accounts or you just mean a type of person? OK, specific accounts?

Lem Quimpo   1:01:37
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's specific account. Yeah, that's right. So, yeah, that's specific accounts.

Peter Wolf   1:01:48
So this is this. To do this we would need to do a search that says OK, find me the most influential posters on.

Lem Quimpo   1:01:52
OK.
Yeah, for example, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:02:09
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:02:10
Uh, like corporate pressure something. So we could just add his username here and then add some like for example 10 people and then our like output would be much better like it's very specific for that profiles because they are already talking about uh.

Peter Wolf   1:02:10
Yeah.
The topics that we're interested in, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:02:25
Finance and stuff because yeah, because Bart also said in the past, right? Like he didn't recommend Reddit because that was the main issue. And then Twitter also that's the main issue. But I think if we could search just the specific accounts of that person or like the list of persons, so.
The output would be much better and much in line with the with the one that we want to add here on the social signals, so if that makes sense.

Peter Wolf   1:02:54
It does.

Bartosz Borek   1:02:55
To be honest, I'm not sure. I mean, what kind of content are we gonna find on Twitter though?

Lem Quimpo   1:03:00
Uh, yeah. So that's the only.

Peter Wolf   1:03:01
I don't. I mean, I think you're gonna, you're gonna find some stuff that again, this is intended to be what social media talking about. And so if you so let me let me just do a quick search here on for example, hold on.

Bartosz Borek   1:03:02
Like that, that's.

Peter Wolf   1:03:24
Oh.

Lem Quimpo   1:03:27
Yeah, because on LinkedIn we're actually also doing the same. We're like scraping the posts of the particular persons on LinkedIn. So that's why I was also thinking in this route we could add because now we just have LinkedIn here on our scraping system.
So we just have linked in here for the social media, so I think that would uh also.
Um.
Add to other social media and I think we could also do YouTube but also for like specific accounts.
Uh.
We could scrape also and.

Bartosz Borek   1:04:14
What does it do then? It scrapes it scrapes the transcript or how does it know?

Lem Quimpo   1:04:19
Yeah, that's right. It would script the transcript. Yeah, that's right. So it would search for the posts of that like accounts and then it would, yeah, spit out the basically the transcript of that that video and then.
Yeah, now we could process that one and then add it on our socials and then together with the link. So yeah, I think because last time that's why I was also confused on how to like get the data because I thought that we were searching like the whole Internet for her or like for.
Example the whole YouTube for that particular content and then when we added the LinkedIn step and then you ask for the specific profile. So that's Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:05:03
Yeah, so here, hold on. So let me let me share my screen. Um.

Lem Quimpo   1:05:07
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:05:12
Think I'm on the right one.
Yeah, so I just said this the top ten most influential accounts, most prolific voices posting on the X about intersection between corporate finance, corporate treasury technology and process automation. So here's Citigroup was the managing director of Citigroup head of Digital Americas posting Brian Zhang, co-founder, Cambridge Center.
Alternative finance, it's at FCA, Bank of America, Bank of England, active commentator on fintech innovation, Treasury co-founder of trade web, major electronic trading platform. I mean I I would think if we listed these that they come up with some stuff that would be you know.
Trending topics Founder, CEO of your CFO guy, Treasury and Cash Otimization Specialist.
So hold on so if I take these.
And let's say go back to perplexity.
If perplexity can't do this, I don't know. What was my hold on, let me add these here and then.
Wait, stop.
Using the.
Accounts listed.
I asked.
It is.
10.

Lem Quimpo   1:07:16
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:07:29
Uh.
See what it comes up with.
I just right away we had a big dream finance 2035 years in how far we come 2020 leading firms predicted finance function would be radically transformed blah blah blah. I I got to believe we Gen. AI and finance isn't a pipe dream. Companies are deployed right?

Bartosz Borek   1:08:30
All right. OK.

Peter Wolf   1:08:33
I mean that that seems like just just doing that, taking the top ten that we just that I just did in 30 seconds. If we did the same thing on LinkedIn, I think if we just stuck with LinkedIn and X that we could we could get content that would be.

Bartosz Borek   1:08:33
All right.

Peter Wolf   1:08:49
Of value here. Now maybe again, I don't know if it's better using your approach or using perplexity. I don't know which one's going to be giving us.

Lem Quimpo   1:08:49
Yeah, yeah, they were just gonna use for plastic, right?
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:09:00
Giving us good content. As I read through it again, I feel very proud of the team treasury reflecting milestones. Last week I walked into the team.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:04
I'm just not sure if can we get also like the link here for this maybe?

Peter Wolf   1:09:11
Yeah, hold on. OK.
Uh.
List again, but with the REC H2X posts.
Yeah, maybe it's hallucinating all this stuff.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:29
Uh, yeah, so.

Peter Wolf   1:09:30
It.
Find out right now.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:48
No, it's, yeah, it's, uh, it's good.

Peter Wolf   1:09:54
No, but it didn't take us to the right link.
But I don't know if I'm even logged in. I never. I never use X, so I'm not logged in. I don't even know how. I have to find my. Let me see if I log in. If that matters. I don't even remember what my login is. Hold on a second.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:58
Oh, it's a different.

Peter Wolf   1:10:18
Hold on.
Mm.
Hey.
And now I'm logged in. Hold on. Um.
Here.
Now let's see what happens when I click on this link.
That doesn't seem to be the same article, right?
I studied finance accounting today. I'm an entrepreneur doing everything. Or is this his overview?
Again, I don't. I don't use X guys, so I have no idea.

Bartosz Borek   1:11:44
London.

Peter Wolf   1:11:48
Five key lessons.
It's taking me back to the same person. I don't know. Am I somehow linked to this person here?

Bryan Wolf   1:11:58
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:12:04
It doesn't seem like it's taking me to.

Bartosz Borek   1:12:05
Maybe it's just a bad link. Maybe it was provide a bad link was provided.
'Cause it it took you to the same, it took you to.
Particularly.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:12
Like regular legs that are like standard.

Peter Wolf   1:12:15
Say again, no link, no recent post. OK, link report.
Oh, this is LinkedIn.
All right, I I I mean, maybe we use your approach and and see what we get taking those ten that I just had. If I just paste them in, if you can put them into LEM into what you're doing here. If I add this, hold on.
That's wrong thing. What?
This.
Good.
Hello.
Sure.
Yeah, I know this is all tedious stuff, but I I again, it would kill me to get these flows to this point and then not progress them to the end, right? So this is where it's going to be more challenging, I'm sure.
Um.
But I think this is, this is what we need to be doing. We need to get this stuff to where we're going to get good content. And so it's going to take trial and error or if we go and find these ten like we just saw, OK, what were the top posts even though even though those it listed those people, it doesn't look like they're all that prolific a poster because.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:10
Nothing.

Peter Wolf   1:14:22
I just said what was the? I didn't even give a time range, right? I just said give me, give me the.
But most prolific, what did I say here?
Right. Using this In the top most highly engaged posts, but then it came back with some people didn't have any any posts. Well, obviously then they're not that active, right? No recent relevant high engagement post for query. I'm not sharing here, so maybe we need to do a.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:55
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:14:56
A bit more of a analysis here and come up with, you know, more prolific posters than than that.

Lem Quimpo   1:15:01
Yeah, I think someone also mentioned Medium. I think Nick mentions or Brian, I I forgot Medium. So they there's like also like a platform that.

Peter Wolf   1:15:09
What was it?

Lem Quimpo   1:15:17
People share their uh like long form content.

Peter Wolf   1:15:18
Yeah, but I don't, I don't think of that as social media, right. I mean maybe I'm maybe I'm not thinking of it In a In a way that I should, but I really think of social media as what like what are the trending topics is going to be either on Twitter or again LinkedIn, I'd say for US, for a business environment, it's one of those environments I would think.

Lem Quimpo   1:15:21
Oh, OK, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
Mm-hmm. Yep. Thank you.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:15:38
I think when we looked at Reddit to me it seems too I I think 1 heavily technology. It's also too I wild Wild West to me like I don't I feel like but I guess X is like that too but depending on the accounts you go look at right so.

Lem Quimpo   1:15:57
Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:15:58
I I think if we stick to X and and and LinkedIn that that's our two best environments for finding stuff that's going to be In the domain that we're interested in. But I think we need to do a further search to come up with better.

Lem Quimpo   1:16:11
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:16:15
A better list of accounts. Again, if you look right here that I I only said give me the top ten, I said give me the top ten voices. But then it gave me these people that when I said OK, show me a post from them, but it didn't have anything, right?
No publicly available, highly engaged posts. So obviously I wouldn't want those people listed on there. These are this is pretty relevant. That's May. This is June, July. But this is pretty old, right? If they're only posting every seven months, that's not worth having.
You want somebody who's going to be more engaged In that, I think.

Lem Quimpo   1:16:47
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   1:16:54
Yeah, you know, that's the problem also with like Twitter is that, you know, even In the past for like, you know, investing, there was someone who would post really good content and then one day they just like randomly stopped. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:17:07
Stop disappeared. Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   1:17:09
Yeah, they totally disappeared. So it's like that's always gonna be a risk when you rely on separate accounts.

Peter Wolf   1:17:14
OK, but over time, over time, you'll morph this too, right? If right now we can just say, you know, change this to say who are the most prolific posters who consistently post. But I guess if they're also, if they're, if they're important people and they only post every six months, but they post something powerful, well.

Bartosz Borek   1:17:18
Yeah.
Of course, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:17:34
You know, maybe you do want them on there and and then what they have to say is worthwhile to consider.
But you give a bigger list to the to the feed of what you know what what Lem is showing that scraper was it appify.

Bartosz Borek   1:17:52
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:17:53
Yeah, I'll be fine. That's right.

Peter Wolf   1:17:59
OK, um.
So what what I'd like to do is I would like to well.
I would like to, I would like to try to refine this list, do a bunch of prompting to ask perplexity or JCPT or whatever to come up with a a good list and I would say we probably should expand it, make it 20 accounts.
We should look for ones that have at least posted or at least posting once per month or a couple times per month or something like that. Put that kind of parameter In there and it may take US, a few iterations, but I think that Will give US, that should give US, something decent and then same thing on on LinkedIn. We should be doing the same.
Same kind of thing to come up with a a curated set of of accounts to be looking at. And I forget on the LinkedIn we do have a LinkedIn search right now, right? We we are doing the LinkedIn search.

Lem Quimpo   1:18:53
Yep.
Yep, that's right with the profiles. Yeah, it's a pretty long list. Also, I think we have 25 something of a person there and we're.

Peter Wolf   1:19:10
And can we go to our spreadsheet? Like what's? Is this running right now? Is it running? So are we getting this populated daily?

Lem Quimpo   1:19:17
Yeah, that's right. I'm the one that I've already built is the SOP for database agent flow and the newsletter flow, newsletter process flow. So the other ones I haven't updated yet the SOP document.

Peter Wolf   1:19:32
But Brian, do we have, we have the process In my environment that's doing this social media search right now every day.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:41
No, it's not on right now 'cause we're doing. It's a prototype. I don't have it running 24/7 'cause I mean, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:19:47
OK. Well, This is why I want to bring these things to production. I want to, I want to get them running on a daily basis, not that they're running every hour or anything like that. I mean, right now we had it. So we have In a reader that should be running once per day. We should have the perplexity running once per day once you get that put In there. And again, you have to put the constraint In to say only In the.

Lem Quimpo   1:20:00
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:20:06
The last 24 hours. Now the one thing I think about the the problem with that approach is that has something had an opportunity to really get a footing if you say In the last 24 hours. Now you alternative might be say give me give me articles. If you're saying the perplexity search, give me articles.

Lem Quimpo   1:20:12
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:20:24
That were posted In the, you know, posted two days ago because I'm thinking about if you run this every day and it's going and it's doing a search and it's only you're going to get repeats. You're going to get repeats if you say you'll give me the last week and you do it every day. But so you'd have to say something like but you want to give it time so that it maybe.

Lem Quimpo   1:20:37
Yeah, but.

Peter Wolf   1:20:44
Can catch some footing to determine what is being the most talked about. So you can't really say the last 24 hours because it might not even gotten, wouldn't even gotten through a full cycle, news cycle, right? So it's kind of like you might say from two days ago.

Lem Quimpo   1:20:50
Oh.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:20:59
Specifically, and it's always from 2 days ago and every day you're pulling, it's from 2 days ago. That way it's had a little bit of time to get some traction and we see how that prompt works saying give me articles that are from two days ago perpetually that have the highest engagement, something like that.

Lem Quimpo   1:21:14
OK. For perplexity, right, that's for the OK, yeah. And also we have also the deduplication filter that is filtering the link. So yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:21:19
Yeah.
Yeah, but I and I understand that. But if we're telling it only to give US, the top ten and it comes back and nine of those are copies from the previous day, that's not going to help us, right? It's not going to progress US, further. So filtering out by saying a certain timeline, a certain time window that we're only searching that window on any given day.

Lem Quimpo   1:21:35
Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:21:44
Then we know we shouldn't be getting duplicates, except for you know, reader to perplexity. There we could get duplicates, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:21:47
Yep.
For inner reader to. Yeah, that's right because.

Peter Wolf   1:21:54
Yeah, because perplexity's sourcing it differently than In a reader. So they may become duplicates and and then our duplicate search would avoid that, right? Or it needs to.

Lem Quimpo   1:21:59
And.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, it would avoid that one. That's right. That's correct.

Peter Wolf   1:22:09
OK, so we're hour and 20 minutes into this.

Lem Quimpo   1:22:15
Oh.

Peter Wolf   1:22:16
Path, I want to focus on bringing the newsletter to fruition. So Bart, if you can work with Ryan's got to bring up to speed the content that we have or the flows process flow that we have in our environment to incorporate what Lim has added with perplexity we need to work.

Lem Quimpo   1:22:17
Hello.
Anything else?
I can.

Peter Wolf   1:22:37
Work on what the revised prompts are In the In the article writing, right? Or the commentary slash summary of the article. That's one. We need to ensure that we have an appropriate prompt In the introduction.
And at the conclusion, now, I don't know, maybe the conclusion doesn't really need all that much. Maybe it's very short, maybe having persona there doesn't really matter. But I I think at those three points, it seems that's the places where we're saying where the persona is going to come into play and then.
We need to refine what we're saying is our sources for social media and that hopefully we can again through kind of searching particular accounts that we can come up with a a better curated set to to include X.

Lem Quimpo   1:23:22
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:23:34
In along with with LinkedIn, then Brian, you're going to set this up to start running every day. I want to see the output. I want to see what we're getting as selection criteria as this thing is progressing starting today. As soon as you get it set up or right now even you can activate the inner reader, activate the flow as it is now. At least the inner reader one would be.

Lem Quimpo   1:23:46
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:23:53
Processing, right. So I want that to execute on a daily basis so that we when we're going In and seeing, OK, how well is this, how well is this selecting articles? Is it good or bad? Add those additionally, add those article those.
Those few other sources into a a custom RSS feed for Inno reader, right?
Then I think on the on the social media, I don't think we're doing really a commentary. We're just saying these are the these are the latest topics on social media, the trending topics. We don't really need to have a commentary on there. Thoughts on that?
Or should there be some kind of theme oriented of, you know, overarching? It's like, hey, everybody's talking about the latest this or that, or does that seem like we're just forcing too much?

Lem Quimpo   1:24:37
Um.

Peter Wolf   1:24:49
And that really, this just speaks for itself. This is what the latest trending topics are. We are not adding any commentary. This is just giving you visibility to what's going on In LinkedIn and Axe.
Any comments? Thoughts?

Lem Quimpo   1:25:01
Oh yeah, what we.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:03
I think that's good, like they let it speak for itself. We don't need to add over overflow with a bunch more information. That's just, you know, fluff.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:05
Actually.

Peter Wolf   1:25:11
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   1:25:12
I I would agree. I think. I think since we're already like kind of opining on the articles that you know the this other stuff. Yeah, exactly like you know.

Peter Wolf   1:25:18
Yeah, we don't have to pine on everything.
Yeah, I I think that's good too, because the the articles were doing a little bit more meaty and the the content should be a little bit more meaty and the opining can be a little bit more meaty, right. That's say, oh, these are big articles. Then the the part about social media is like, hey, this is what everybody's talking about. Like, OK, you can see it unfiltered. Here it is. Here's what people are talking about.
About we don't need to to add commentary on it. Then I think that other section where we're going to include our blogs and all I I don't know if we or I I guess you know what are what are thoughts on that it's like.
I think we need to have there needs to be some introduction to it or there needs to be something that's said there, whether it has to have a persona or not, there needs to be something written there saying, hey, there's the here's the latest stuff we've written on that we think you'll find interesting or.
But I think those they or or does it, I guess maybe I need to ask that because I'm saying it does, but does it? Can we pull back up our our draft? I really, I really want this thing up and running so that we're seeing what this would be looking like if we were running it right now as it is.

Lem Quimpo   1:26:26
Oh, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:26:32
Right, because we had that turned on, then we turned it back off, but.
I want to see how these things are looking and that means that, oh, that means that we would have to be because it only triggers when we execute it from the spreadsheet, right. At least we'd be getting the spreadsheet populated. But then we could go and I I think we need to go the extra step and maybe it's a daily task for you. Brian, go in, we select three.

Lem Quimpo   1:26:47
Yep, that's right. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:26:57
Articles. And then we push it through to make sure we get the output to see what the end result would be, what the commentaries would be, what the final product would look like. And right now we're producing it and we're sending it to our own accounts, right? So it's not a problem. It's not like it's going somewhere we're not controlling.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:06
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:10
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:27:13
I think we should be doing that on a daily basis. So can you make a note of that, Brian? I'll work with you and we'll go through and we'll pick what articles we're doing. But I want this to be producing every day now.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:23
Sure.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:27:26
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:27
Yeah, I I I would also need to, I think, give the new Jason because I've changed a lot on the. Yeah, on the.

Peter Wolf   1:27:32
Yeah, Yep, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:34
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:27:35
Agreed. You definitely have to work with him. OK, so let me let me let me change tracks here a minute. So that's one thing, right? That's going to be Brian and and Bart and Lem working on that. And then on the on on some of these other things, I'm going to move forward with the with identifying and hiring.
Hiring a resource, I think maybe maybe Nick, could you do some research to find out for me what I need to do to set up this environment? I think we had talked about it before. If I'm gonna, I already have a, you know, a.

Gilles Gilmart   1:28:01
Yes.

Peter Wolf   1:28:12
365 Microsoft 365 account. What do I need to do to set up an environment so that I can have the Microsoft copilot and all that stuff? Or do you already know?

Nicholas Westburg   1:28:23
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:28:25
You already know or you say you research it?

Nicholas Westburg   1:28:28
Oh no, no. I'm saying that I'll do some research and get back to you.

Peter Wolf   1:28:30
OK, awesome. Good. So then we'll we'll get something set up there where we can try to.
This enablement database right that we talked about and that I said we were going to deliver and that I think you guys, not I think I know you guys have been working on building this spreadsheet and combining stuff together and I know Nick you were you had created.
Some kind of app where we were where you can access information. We need to get together and talk about that. We need to go through that spreadsheet, figure out what that content is. And I was doing some, you know, some discussion with ChatGPT about, you know, how can we structure this? What are some creative ways what their intention to do is right now.

Lem Quimpo   1:29:08
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   1:29:27
They.
First of all, they want something. They're starting a new website, internal website, and they want to put some of our content on there. They're not expecting everything's going to be ready, but they want to put some content on there. And I think this is going to be all focused on AI. What's the company doing In AI, right? And then their intention is ultimately to store.
And create a SharePoint site that's going to contain this enablement with our material being a foundational portion of that. And so we need to go through and figure out, OK, what are those component pieces that we've already talked about that we've already kind of categorized. So you got some kind of prompting library we got.
Um, YouTube videos. We've got certification courses, we've got.
Well, I don't even know what else, but all these things combined together. We need to then look at this stuff and start to figure out how we're going to, again, curate it In a way that makes it logical. Because my intention is that we create something that says, hey, hey, you're a beginner and you want to go down this path. Here's a way to do it.
Here's the courses to take. The other thing that I was looking at that I would be very interested In In kind of talking through with you guys is like I was chatting with Chad GPD about again, part of these are window dressing, partly because I think they're cool, partly because I think they'll be good on your.
On the resumes for for the interns and partly because I think they're more engaging for user community if we actually create them is creating custom GPT. Well, custom GPT, yeah, we could use ChatGPT and do that and we could use that as a foundational approach.
But probably this would be something we would build based on the discussion I was having within the Microsoft environment, again using Microsoft Copilot and Microsoft tools because In that environment we can also load all the documents into a location, essentially doing like a rag structure where we can supplement.
The prompting requests with the core content that we already have stored In there, and then it could come back with a kind of curated answer, but then supplement it with the broader knowledge that's available, right? So In that case, we could have all these different sources of Information and say, hey, you're a.
I'm a beginner. I want to go In and I want to learn about how do I start just even learning about AI. That's good. OK, great. Here's a glossary of terms. Here's a beginner's guide for YouTube videos. And then on that as well, it's like we need to take these to the next level. It's all those YouTube videos I created that.
A prompt that I've been using for MIT courses where it's high fidelity to what was originally said. It doesn't. It doesn't hallucinate and supplements. It's like, what is the content that's In here In a very structured manner? I think we take the transcript from each one of those YouTube videos, run it through that. So we get a we get an organized.
Overview that's consistent pattern for every video and then we can rank them or score them. I mean, I guess we wouldn't include them In the less unless we thought they were good, but we would rank them from the perspective of this is for a newbie, this is for someone who's intermediate, this is for someone who's more advanced.
And I think right now we're looking at all kind of beginner and intermediate stuff. But I think having that that overview is really critical too. We would take an overview that's detailed overview can do a short summary like we're talking about here with the articles so that we give them a way that they don't have to go watch the whole thing to understand, well, I want to pick this one and this one because.
These are the ones that are going down the path. I want by reading the summary and looking at the overview. I think those are things, not I think these are things that we need to do over the coming days because they're expecting US, to work with Floor, who's the operations manager and who's supposed to be very good at this kind of stuff In in.
And she's going to be responsible for trying to organize and structure this somewhere on a SharePoint. But I would like to look at some creative additional ways, like maybe an iPhone app that would allow you to access certain content or for like prompting or again this custom GPT.
Or custom Microsoft copilot where we could feed it In certain stuff and say this is what this is kind of the direction we want the responses to be and leveraging these tools. Here are some a list of primary sources of videos and or certifications and training courses and.
Stuff like that.
Any thoughts to that? Comments, questions?
OK, so I I think Nick, I don't know what your availability is. I would be interested In In getting you engaged on this stuff too, especially if we're talking about maybe trying to come up with some creative app or something like that that might let US, access you. You showed some stuff we haven't had a chance to look at. I would like to drill into whatever stuff you've already.
We built that we're along these lines and see does this make sense, something we could leverage for broader for the organization or is there some way we can, yeah, tweak it, adjust it, incorporate it?

Bryan Wolf   1:34:43
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:34:47
Yeah, that'd be great. I I was trying to, I was muted for a second, but one thing that I found really useful too too is like you have all these big providers, right? You have Open AI, Claw, Anthropic, Gemini, so forth and so on.

Peter Wolf   1:34:50
OK.
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   1:35:03
And a lot of these big providers now, they have really, really cool courses and documentation, right? And there's nothing better than getting that source of information directly from the provider itself, right? And it's the most reliable, trustworthy. You don't have to worry about, well, is this person.

Peter Wolf   1:35:14
Directly from them, yeah, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:35:22
You know, giving us what we need. Is this how you do XYZ and kind of take that and put it together in some form of like formal, you know, this is everything in terms of how to utilize the API, the different models.

Peter Wolf   1:35:23
Have a slander. Yep.
Yep.
I think, I think that's a great idea. Also the matrix, right? We talked about and I think we actually even built some stuff and certainly it's not that I think that challenging for US, to do is build a matrix that compares those primary models, right? The primary natural language models to say because to me the more I use them, the different ones, the more I see they.

Nicholas Westburg   1:35:51
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:35:57
Certain benefits or not, and I don't know, it's just me for like example, Claude, not Claude, Grok. Even when Grok Will give me kind of specific lists and details and all this kind of stuff, whenever I cut and paste that into something, it comes out as one big long stream. It just never structure, it never formats. But you know, Chat CPD format's great.

Nicholas Westburg   1:36:11
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:36:17
Format's great. And again on the on the audio, right, the audio modality, I think those are kind of critical differentiators. And when we talk about the writing capability or projects In Claude versus custom GPTS In In ChatGPT, I think if you build a matrix like that, I think that.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:26
OK.
No.

Peter Wolf   1:36:37
That would be really helpful and insightful of why you'd go to one over another. And then if you supplemented that with again this kind of direct insight Information from those and kind of pulled together the best of the best and created some some database of Information that stored that that made it readily accessible, right?

Nicholas Westburg   1:36:39
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:36:57
Or again, maybe you extract all that, you put it into a Microsoft environment and then it can index it In that Azure. It can index everything. And then again, it's like that rag supplemental. You say, I have a question about it's not searching the Internet broadly. It's like, OK, first I'm gonna go here.

Nicholas Westburg   1:37:11
They can pull, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:37:16
Now extracted the best Information from each of these sources, put it together. So if I'm asking a fundamental question, I'm getting a really strong answer here and then it can go and give you supplemental external sources, right? I think that's a really pretty cool thing to to build, just like again, like a chat bot that is gonna leverage.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:27
No.

Nicholas Westburg   1:37:28
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:37:36
That kind of curated data first. Yeah, yeah. And I think if you build that as as kind of supplement, you're trying to say ramping people up. I think that's a great way to do it. And I think the more creative we are In In building this, again, I think it looks really good on the resumes. I think it.

Nicholas Westburg   1:37:38
For documentation.

Peter Wolf   1:37:54
I think it would create good content that's more manageable to to access and to go through because part of this that I keep hearing people say is they just don't even know where to start. I can't believe people Will start talking about still talking about where do they start. They should have started a long time ago, but.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:01
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:38:11
The fact that they just don't even, there's so much **** out there now, they don't even know where to begin. So I think having something that really is like, here's a beginner, here's the first thing you should do. Here's a here's a simplified because there's a really good, I remember from very early In the MIT class, it might have been the last one. It was just like an overview of what is.
What is LLM, right? And it just was really very, it was delivered In a very simplistic manner that was easy to consume but was insightful. I think that's the kind of thing you need or you need to say, OK, here's the first thing you should do. Go read this. Then you can look at these, look at our comparison, here's our reviews of these other things and kind of work your way up and you have a learning path.
But that's going to take a little bit of effort to to to curate. We got to look through what we have and figure out what do we need more supplemental and but that really has to happen over the next couple of days because I know that Fluor is going to reach out to US, and be looking to move forward because they're coming out with this website and they want some of our content on there.
So I need to show that we've made some progress and also because I know you do have and then stuff like that prompting library, right? Not just, I mean simple prompts, but also more comprehensive prompts and things like the persona prompt. I think that's a great freaking thing, right? Everybody should have a persona prompt. Well, yeah, here's a detailed example of persona prompt.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:15
OK.
Yes, yes, yes.

Peter Wolf   1:39:30
For you know that that kind of thing. Or this extracting, you know, good content with fidelity, not not adding into it, embellishing or anything else from a from a transcript. That's I I played around with that for a long time and got a lot of crap. It's like you really need to refine on what you're asking it to do to ensure you're getting.
Having good output, I think those are good examples. So having that kind of prompt library, these are all great things that we've already looked at and started to pull together. I think we just need again, I feel like everything is at this point where we have these great drafts and prototypes that now need to be brought to fruition. We need to curate them a little more. We need to clean them up a little more.
We need to refine them a little bit more to get them where they are production ready.
Then I guess the the last thing is on the Jill on the O data and the the Microsoft environment, we already said OK, we're gonna start to move forward. We're just.
We're going to transition in, whether it's we're building them first In another Microsoft environment and then transferring them over or we're going to sit parallel and work In the Microsoft environment. We need to start putting these into the Microsoft environment. I don't know if we need. We already checked and we have. I believe everybody has access, right? Peter, Brian.
Nick, me, we did that before you left. We went and checked that, right? So I don't think we have any issues there. Maybe do a follow up with Siddhartha again if you haven't since you've been back and just ask him like look, we're going to start building flows In here and you know is do we have the environment you're wanting US, to do this In or we just move?

Gilles Gilmart   1:41:00
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:41:10
Moving forward with what we have, right? Astonishing that again, two months after really making this a big deal, still nothing, right? But let's push that and and then you know what I would like to do is is reach out to those couple other people and maybe Siddharth is one of them. Maybe he is doing stuff not In this environment.

Gilles Gilmart   1:41:20
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:41:30
Part, but he's maybe is working on flows, him and then that guy, Michael Gerard, I think his last name, who's the sales guy who was apparently, you know, was pretty active when we were In those sessions. He seemed to be building some stuff. I'd like to get together with these guys. It's talk through what they're doing, show them the stuff that we're doing and just see what else.
This is what, you know, what they might be achieving that can stimulate US, as well and vice versa, what we're doing that can stimulate them. And then finally, Daniel, Dan was going to have a session that he ended up canceling, which was supposed to be an overview of everything we're doing In the company In AI. And I think that was like that was.

Gilles Gilmart   1:41:55
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:42:09
Not maybe it was gonna be last Friday. Maybe it was the Friday before that, but it was canceled. I think we should reach out to Daniel and see what was his source Information he was gonna use. I do have. I do have, I believe.

Gilles Gilmart   1:42:16
It was moved, I think, no.
I've got it next week, sorry, on the Friday the 1st of August. Any enablement sessions? Yeah, it's it's been pushed to next week. Next.

Peter Wolf   1:42:27
OK.
OK.
I do have a well, they've now come up. Let me show you what's from the strategy group. What was what's the latest here if I can find where do I put everything on?
Oh um.
Oh.
Go here, cancel that.
It's not that.
Yeah, so they've finally created a comprehensive use case list. I have not had a chance to go through this yet.
Let me share.
Right here they put this In In In JIRA and it's got a list impact effort implementation where it's stand implementation grade and department Gen. AI tools rating. So they've at least now this was Daniel Diebenbacher pulled all this together I think from the source content.
I would like to go through here and see where what stuff we had presented or provided, whether that's made it In here, where do these come from or look at these and again get a get a assessment of that plus.
Where was the? Hold on a second.
Operational AI.
Strategy group.

Gilles Gilmart   1:44:18
Oh.

Peter Wolf   1:44:47
What the hell are they doing it?
I'll have to look around again. I I want that that full list I thought I had. I thought it was In here. They provided to HG Capital every month. It shows every initiative that we have, but they've already done some stuff that I don't want to rebuild the, you know, the wheel on like chatbot and using teams.
Teams where they're using teams with FS2 integration to go capture Information and from my understanding from what Daniel Bartaska what he had there that was they were what he had said they were working on a you know a chat bot for.
For some stuff that wasn't product related, right? It was about US, internal. So again, I don't want to recreate these things and if we're building these environments, we're going to be doing teams integration and all that kind of stuff. I want to be leveraging these, so I want to get connected with these guys.
So first, if you can reach out to Siddharth, find out if he's if anything's going on there In the environment and whether there's anything we need to know and then ask him if he's been working on flows or what, you know, if he's seen anybody else or who he's aware of that's that's actually building stuff In there to try.

Gilles Gilmart   1:46:36
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:46:47
And get insight that we can reach out to those people and connect.
And then we'll figure out I'll, I'll reach out to Daniel and see what he meant to to both Daniels, Daniel Bartasca and Daniel Debaker to see about getting this other information.

Gilles Gilmart   1:47:04
And and you much.
You wanted to talk to Mark as well, right? Who was very active during the copilot sessions, so to share ideas and yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:47:07
Sorry.
Yeah, yeah. Well, that's what I'm saying. If you ask, I know Mark was, so we definitely reach out to him. But I'm saying if you ask, I'm, I'm thinking that Siddhartha, who's supposed to be kind of centered on the IT on this, should be aware of other people that are working on it. Whether that's true or not, I don't know. But I'm hoping that maybe he can give US, some insight onto who other like Mark.

Gilles Gilmart   1:47:21
Yeah, yeah.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:47:29
Other people that are working on things, OK.

Gilles Gilmart   1:47:32
Yeah, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:47:34
All right, so I pretty much burned that two hours. What I would like is Brian, for you to push forward with Lem, you send the new Jason, Brian, you work on updating that stuff. If I don't know if we need to extract again or more or different or what from the prompts.
So that we could refine on those prompts or how, how do we see that being best moved forward?

Bartosz Borek   1:48:01
With the proper finding, Peter, well, I'll just send the new prompts. I'll just make the edits that we talked about today and I'll send them over to Lem.

Peter Wolf   1:48:03
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:06
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:48:07
So you have the, you have the spots where all that was, right? Well, he pulled it out before you already have the content that needs to. OK, OK, OK, great. So then let's push forward with that. And then again, now assuming that you're gonna have the feed of the summary and a longer.

Bartosz Borek   1:48:13
I have. I have all of it. I have all of it, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:48:26
Well, I don't, I can't remember what the wording was. Relevance, right? A lot of relevance that that you'll write a prompt that says combine these two together with a focus of blah blah blah, our target market and and write US, something that's compelling. But again managing on that scale one to 10, it's not sales 10, you know, but.

Lem Quimpo   1:48:26
Relevance. Uh, relevance, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:39
Right.

Peter Wolf   1:48:44
But bring something into it that that makes it kind of interesting. Seems like every time we we tell it to really get motivated, it goes way over the top, right? Remember when it came up with every one of those trademark terminologies for every document we've ever created In In our methodology, it's like, OK, that's a little bit, that's a little bit too much.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:47
It.

Bartosz Borek   1:48:53
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:49:02
But something that's that's got a little bit of spice that doesn't overdo it.
All right, then, Nick, if you can, I mean, Nick, you want to start pulling together and identifying with a spreadsheet or whatever else where where we can be grabbing this kind of foundational Information about the different, the different primary natural language models.
That would be great. And then we can connect and talk about and if you can show US, that app that you have, then we can schedule some time and see what you've already done and talk about different ways that we can engage. I would love to have some kind of iPhone app or it even was saying, well, you know, you can put these apps on the website, right? We come up with an app that we want.
It could be a chat bot, but integrated In there. And then again, this would be the the stuff where we talked about the the kind of enhanced rag for particular content that we would already curate a baseline to and then it could supplement from there, right. So I would like to talk about those things.

Nicholas Westburg   1:50:00
The app would be really cool.

Peter Wolf   1:50:01
Yeah, yeah. OK. I'm, I'm gonna drop and then, yeah, I'll follow up with you guys. But if you guys can continue to push forward on that stuff, I'd appreciate it. OK.

Bartosz Borek   1:50:15
All right. Thanks, Peter. Yep. Take care. Have a good end.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:15
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:50:15
Thanks. See you. Bye.

Lem Quimpo   1:50:17
OK, Peter, got it.

Gilles Gilmart   1:50:18
Thanks everyone.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:25
All right, Lam, you want to send me these files?

Lem Quimpo   1:50:28
Yeah, I'm just also updating the because there's a lot of updates on this session, so I would still be, yeah, updating the like the Jason for.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:36
I know, yeah.
Um, I don't even need you to really walk me through it. You can just send it to me and then I can just set it up on my system.

Lem Quimpo   1:50:49
Yep. OK, no problem. Yeah, I I think we've already. Oh, not sure if I've already. Yeah, I think there's I yeah, you could also check the documentation or the Loom videos. I also, I think, yeah, I already have here.
But yeah, let me just uh update the uh like uh the flows 1st and then I'll give you the.
The complete complete. Oh, I'll just send you the ones that I've updated.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:17
OK.
What?
So you want to change the instructions first, the props first, and then is that what you're saying? You want to do everything first? I mean, because I it looks like you only added Claude In there from what I saw. Or did you add others? Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:51:33
Yeah, just cloud, yeah yeah. But the other, the other ones I've changed like the structure formatting for example. But I I think mostly like these are just three, three automations. So the other ones doesn't. I didn't update the other one, so it's basically the same.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:41
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:51:52
And then, yeah, I'll just send you the ones that I've changed so that you could just update that one with your credentials, your cloud. Then for the prompts, yeah, we will. We can wait for Bart's prompt and then you can just copy and paste it to the cloud. So that that would be, yeah, yeah, as much.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:52
OK.
OK.
Yeah, very easy, very easy stuff.

Lem Quimpo   1:52:12
Yeah, that would be, uh, much easier also. And then Yep, I think that that's, uh, that's it. I'll be.

Bryan Wolf   1:52:15
Yeah.
