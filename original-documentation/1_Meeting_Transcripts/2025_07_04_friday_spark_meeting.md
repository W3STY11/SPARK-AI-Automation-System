Bryan Wolf   0:06
So I think Pete's gonna get on and just.

0:09
OK.

Lem   0:09
OK.

Bryan Wolf   0:09
Talk to you about whatever. I think today's the holidays and I should be working, but I just want to make sure you got that e-mail I sent you.
Oh.

Lem   0:19
Yep, the.

Bryan Wolf   0:19
The prompt. Yeah, I'm sorry it took so long.

Lem   0:21
Yeah, this is the prompt, right? No, yeah, what what I mean is the like the the prompt for the like I know reader, the one that.
Peter sent on the chat, uh, yesterday, so I wasn't able to.

Bryan Wolf   0:35
Resume.
Good.
Oh, that long one. Yes, yes. Second one. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I I know. ****, I don't know if I saved that. I don't know if I saved that. Yeah, for for Chachi BG filter. Yeah, here, I'll probably find it for you.

Lem   0:41
The yeah, the one with, yeah, for the filter.
Uh.
Yep, that's right. Yeah, I just want to test something. Yeah, I also was like researching some like our other RSS feed or some way to like filter. Yeah, get better articles. But yeah, somehow it's actually some some.

Bryan Wolf   1:04
Just get better articles, yeah.

Lem   1:11
Like I've tried like the data, I forgot the name, some websites that actually have like API, then it researches for all. Yeah, but it's kind of broad and it's not just.

Bryan Wolf   1:24
Yeah.

Lem   1:28
There's no filter for like particular websites, so that's that's that's the main problem. So what? Yeah, the good thing here on Inereader actually is we can filter it via website. So it's just that.

Bryan Wolf   1:31
Hey there.
Let's share them with them.

Lem   1:44
We need more I think uh niche down website for the.

Bryan Wolf   1:54
Yeah, I think this is it.

Lem   1:57
Um.
I read there.

Bryan Wolf   2:02
How's your day, love?

Lem   2:04
I just good. Still just busy. Yeah, still.

Bryan Wolf   2:07
Still here, still, still have it. You're it's still late. I I always forget that. I'm sorry.
Yeah, I'm gonna e-mail it to you here now.

Lem   2:15
Yeah, it's right. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   2:19
Yes.
Um.
Yeah.
That's it.

Lem   2:39
Yeah, I also experimented actually with like the IN reader, so we could actually get put a filter on the folder and then we could add also another filter on particular the particular websites.

Bryan Wolf   2:54
Like on the actual I know reader website or like on through make.

Lem   2:54
7.

Peter Wolf   2:56
Really.

Lem   2:57
On no on the uh, let me see it.

Bryan Wolf   3:00
I see. Yeah, yeah. So you're fast. OK.

Lem   3:04
Yeah, share my screen. So yeah, we have this like the folder, right? We could add the filter here on the whole folder. So it filters out. Yeah, it filters out the whole website and then what I did is I added here.

Bryan Wolf   3:17
OK, yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   3:17
Thanks.
OK.

Lem   3:23
Here the AI one. So the filter here is AI and then I've added the finance and like finance treasury to the individual. Yeah the yeah individual website so.

Bryan Wolf   3:27
Right.
Individual actual things. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. That way it's just gonna pull both, yeah.

Lem   3:39
Yeah, because uh, we can't put like ore here, right? Like uh, filter.

Peter Wolf   3:44
The only thing is, like I was saying the other day, it's not just guys, it's not just AI though, right? I mean, it's a technology and all it's it's. I mean, AI obviously is the best spin with the latest and greatest on AI. It'd be terrific. I I would be actually OK if it was all heavy AI and and finance, but.

Bryan Wolf   3:44
For the whole version.

Lem   3:48
Yeah.
Yeah, the.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   4:03
But it's, it's, yeah, I know I'm making this challenging, but really I was looking for what we wrote in that prompt, right? What we wrote in the prompt, which was more, it could be broader Fortune 500 Treasury, corporate Treasury kind of stuff. So what's so all you're saying here is you're.

Lem   4:13
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   4:14
Oh, that's me.

Lem   4:19
Yep.

Peter Wolf   4:23
Making more refinements in the list we in what's being extracted from the list of the e-mail reader. But are we not going to? Are we not then still feeding that prompt? We are. We're saying we're we're filtering what we're getting here and then we're still sending the prompt through for the best five or whatever.

Lem   4:29
Yep, that's right. Uh.
Yeah, we we're still, uh, Yep.
Yep, that's right. The only problem because a while ago I've tested it like for 50 like 50 summaries and I tested also for 30, but ChatGPT wasn't able to. It maxed out the like the.

Bryan Wolf   4:40
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   4:41
OK.
Yeah.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   4:58
It's just too much data for it to process, yeah.

Lem   4:58
The yeah, too much data because there's like a problem when let me just run this one so.

Bryan Wolf   5:06
I think it's also better 'cause like when we push through that much data, it slaughters our API tokens.

Lem   5:10
Yeah, sometimes the content.

Peter Wolf   5:12
I thought we didn't. I thought we said with the summaries it wasn't doing that. It was like 1 transaction wasn't tokens.

Lem   5:16
Yeah, so yeah, for there are for example for other websites, the summary actually is kinda long. As you can see they just like getting the HTML HTML format of the.

Bryan Wolf   5:26
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   5:27
OK.

Bryan Wolf   5:31
You know, it was also only pulling from Business Insider yesterday. No matter what we did, it really just. I mean, not only like there was a couple of things, but it really only chose any articles from Business Insider.

Lem   5:36
Uh.
Yep.
Yeah, mostly on Business Insider. I I think the one also the one issue there is on Inu Reader, Business Insider and like W Wall Street Journal unfortunately they are they are the ones that like.

Bryan Wolf   5:52
Mhm.
Washington.
Top three.

Lem   5:59
Up. Yeah, like post an article every few hours. So the other ones here, like for example quartz, as you can see this is 3 weeks, four weeks, so they're not posting too much. And then yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   6:03
Yeah, OK.

Peter Wolf   6:11
Oh yeah, then we don't we yeah, then that that's not really added value. So I think it goes back to we we have to like the one that we looked at the other day. I think we really need to refine this list of which which company and which sources cause I don't even see the one.

Bryan Wolf   6:12
Yeah.

Lem   6:15
Yep.
I think.
Yep, that's right. Like, uh, the sources. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   6:25
I know, but I also think that just on I know reader there there aren't even that many quality picks. We can definitely add a couple more, but I worry that there's just really not that many great sources.

Peter Wolf   6:34
Yeah, but.
What happened to that one that we were that we just looked up the other day that financed something or other, the really?

Bryan Wolf   6:41
Yeah. What? It was something. Magazine. Global Finance Magazine. Yeah. We've got it on here. Yeah. Yeah. OK, Yeah.

Lem   6:45
Yeah, the Global Finance Magazine, Yep.

Peter Wolf   6:45
Yeah. OK. You do have it. OK. All right. So we need to go through that list again. It was the the web scraper where I was the the sites that I was scraping there. We need to double check. Yeah. OK. Six articles in the week. Oh.

Lem   6:49
Yep, we have that here.
Yeah, they post six articles.
Yep. Uh, makes like an average six articles per week. So it's uh good.

Bryan Wolf   7:01
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   7:03
OK.

Bryan Wolf   7:04
I don't post much, you know.

Peter Wolf   7:06
Yeah.
OK, so that that again, these are things we're gonna have to refine on, but I'm hoping we can get some better refinement there.

Lem   7:13
Yep, this list.

Peter Wolf   7:17
OK. All right. So I wanted to give you a little guidance lemma. I haven't had an opportunity to write this up, but I I think this is what I'd like you to work on when it comes to beginning of next week, right? When you or or what's today? Today's Thursday or Friday? Today's Thursday.

Lem   7:25
OK.

Bryan Wolf   7:33
Today's Friday.

Lem   7:33
Friday. Yep, Friday.

Peter Wolf   7:35
Oh, today's Friday. Hold on. Today's 4th of July.

Bryan Wolf   7:38
Yes, it is 4th of July.

Peter Wolf   7:39
Oh ****. OK, all right. Yeah. So Lim, what I want to do is I want to get that that the the ChatGPT to to Google Docs set up, right? So I want to do.

Lem   7:44
OK.

Peter Wolf   7:56
You know, you said you'd have to go to N8N to do that, but I want to, I want to to if I'm talking to ChatGBT and I'm working on a document, I want to be able to push that out.

Lem   8:00
The.

Peter Wolf   8:11
I want to be able to call it and pull it back and edit it or or make changes to it. So I don't know what what you know. I can understand if I do the create, but I don't quite know how the edits gonna work. Is it gonna put it in change mode and you're gonna see the edits? It's gonna rewrite it. What is?

Lem   8:18
Yep.

Peter Wolf   8:27
How's that work? Do you even know?

Lem   8:27
Yep, that's right. Basically what will the design would be? Let me just for example there's like a AI agent here and then it's it has like a brain, for example the ChatGPT brain and then we will connect it to the tools.

Peter Wolf   8:39
Yeah.

Lem   8:47
For example, basically we will connect it to like automations that are doing that particular task. So for example the creation of a document or editing the document. So the ChatGPT brain will.
Will choose that tool depending on the how you chat the bot. Basically that's how I think I yeah, let me just.

Peter Wolf   9:11
But I'm just saying how does it look? How does it if you? Because you know when I think about changing a document, if I have a Word Microsoft Word document and I have it in change mode, then when you make changes it shows what was there before and it shows like slashes through, strike through the words that you.

Lem   9:16
Yeah.
OK.

Peter Wolf   9:29
Delete it and it puts in new words and it shows highlight it until you accept those changes. Is that how a Google Doc would work? Or it just if it's writing something there and then I say change it, does it just delete everything that's in there and just rewrite it? Or does it make changes to it?

Lem   9:38
Oh.
Yeah, we could. Yeah, that's right. For basically, let me just.
For example like this. So we have like a AI agent brain here and then we will have like an chat box that is we can talk to the particular AI agent.
Then for the chat model this is like the brain and then we will put we will connect it to like the tools. So it's same as make for example we will connect it to like something like this like in for example the creation of documents so Google Doc creation of document.

Peter Wolf   10:28
Yeah.
OK.

Lem   10:30
And then we will also add the tool here for like updating that particular document and then we will add the description per tool and then what will happen is for example the we will chat the the AI agent like can you create a document for example like or like.
This particular document and then there will it will access that tool for that particular task. For example, we will also have a tool for getting the particular document on Google Drive. So basically it's like we are connecting all the automations.

Peter Wolf   11:02
OK.

Lem   11:07
Here on this AI agent and then it it is the one that is choosing the particular automation or system. It will access that system and trigger that system depending on the message that we are we are sending it. Yep.

Peter Wolf   11:14
Yep.
OK, so then if you could start to build that, but ultimately I would want both Google Docs and Google Sheets, right? I'd like it to be able to edit both of those things to create or edit so that I could say, OK, I got a list out there and I wanted to update the list and I could just have it add to that list or if I wanted to.

Lem   11:28
Yep, that's right. Yeah. So, uh.
Yep, that's right. Yep.

Peter Wolf   11:39
If I'm working on some document, I could just say, OK, store that stuff so that I know I don't lose it. And then later on I could retrieve it and say, tell me what's in there so far. OK, great, let's add to it. So if you could work on that, yeah, that'd be great.

Lem   11:45
Yep.
Yes, that's right. Yeah. OK. So for this one, I'll just like add some placeholder, like placeholder like the one sample you added last time is like a birthday, right? Like the name, company, birthday, something like that. OK, then yeah, I'll.

Peter Wolf   12:05
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You can go with that, right? If I I can't, I couldn't remember if I gave that to you or if we talked through it or what, but we were saying, right, I wanted to store a name with some information. If you build that idea, then I can, I can expand or change from that, right? Yeah.

Lem   12:10
Yeah.
Yep.
Yeah, we could just, yeah, that's right. Yeah, we could just, we could, yeah, we could just edit the, like the prompts, the tools to make in that particular use case. Yep.

Peter Wolf   12:28
Yeah, because here's what I'm also looking at. Here's what I'm thinking I'm going to do. I want to build an app. And now I think with this new stuff, this Claude, the Claude artifacts, I think this new functionality. I think Nick was working on this and building some stuff the other day.

Lem   12:48
OK.

Peter Wolf   12:48
I want to. I'm thinking some of this stuff that I'm saying I want to do with ChatGPT. I ultimately probably don't need to do it with ChatGPT. I could make an app and it would be more efficient for me. Right now though, I do want the ChatGPT and I'll ultimately I'll push that to Grock as well.

Lem   13:01
Yep.

Peter Wolf   13:07
Because those two have good audio modality for talking, right? And a lot of times I'm working on stuff and I just want to make sure I store it so I don't lose it. But ultimately I think on this the the name thing is a good example that I would just make an app, a front end app that would have audio modality.

Lem   13:12
OK.

Peter Wolf   13:27
input the the data, and then it would call an AI agent, it would call ChatGPT or whatever. And it was saying, you know when I was actually talking this through with ChatGPT, you could store it. I said, well, where do I store this stuff? I said, well, you could store it in a spreadsheet like you're doing now, like I'm talking about now.

Lem   13:29
Yep.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   13:47
But I could also do a cloud-based data storage, right? If it's not sensitive data, then I could do a cloud-based data storage. But it was saying if I do the if I do the spreadsheet that I would have more control over it and potentially I could use other apps and more easily get to it. I'd also have offline ability to look at it whereas.

Lem   13:47
Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   14:06
With the cloud base, I wouldn't. But you know, nowadays most of the time you're connected almost all the time, right? I mean, it's not. It used to be an issue that you would want to work on stuff offline, but now you're essentially connected all the time. So that's what I'm going to end up doing. But I think by building this stuff, I know that I'll use this and I think it'll also move.

Lem   14:12
Yep.
Yes.

Peter Wolf   14:26
Us in a direction where I can start thinking about it more like that. Then we can build a front end on the the app thing and I'll decide, you know, how I approach that. That's kind of what I'm thinking about.

Lem   14:27
Yep.
OK, yeah, so I think temporarily we could add instead of the chat box here. There's also like some designs which is like building it through Telegram. So the Telegram bot will you would be like you would be.
You would be using the Telegram for chatting the AI agent and then for you could like talk also to it and then we will just transcribe the audio coming from Telegram and then it will also send like the for example the link of the Google document to the Telegram. So this is just like the back end and then the the.
The front end would be like your Telegram chat bot, so that would be one way also to do this one, yeah.

Peter Wolf   15:14
Yeah. So, so let's talk about that. Let me just understand that because you're essentially saying the same thing I'm saying about an app, you're just saying Telegram would be the front end app. But if if we did that, then would it, would we need to do it through N8N? I mean the reason I was thinking to go through N 8 N was because of we were saying that the.

Lem   15:21
Yep, that's right. Yeah, that. Yeah, that telegram would be the front front end. That's right.

Peter Wolf   15:33
That the, you know, the AI chat bots don't have the ability to really connect in to make. But if we were say Telegram or an app was what I was using, then would I have to bother with any then?

Lem   15:35
Uh.
Oh.
Yeah, basically the Telegram is just like the user, like the user interface so that we could access the the AI agent because for this one we would open N8 and then you we could chat the like the bot from here. So what?

Peter Wolf   15:51
Yeah.
Yeah, but what I'm asking you is, is the whole reason I thought we were talking about N8N is because you were saying that you can't the AI agents, it doesn't work well to go from the AI agent outbound. Now if I'm calling the AI agent, the API works. I can send information to the AI agent and get information.

Lem   16:07
Oh uh.

Peter Wolf   16:21
Back, but I can't start from the AIH and you were saying with using mate because we were trying that. Remember at the very beginning we were trying that and you were saying that I really needed to use N8N and then we just kind of bypassed it, right? We just stopped working on it and I said OK, we'll work with some other stuff.

Lem   16:22
Yep.
Um.

Peter Wolf   16:38
But if I'm not really going to do it directly from the chat bot, then I'm then then I'm not really. I don't have the issue, right? I I would use then I could just use make instead of Nan, couldn't I?

Lem   16:39
OK.
Basically the design of this actually make already also have like some design as like this. So basically because the your use case actually the one that we were we talk about last time is you want to interact with the particular AI right and then it will do the thing that you want to do.
So for yeah, and then N810 actually has this particular design, the AI agent and make actually now has this one, the AI agents beta, but I still haven't like used or created.

Peter Wolf   17:12
Yes.

Lem   17:28
Like some systems on this one, but I've just saw like some tutorials on AI agents on make and it's also like yeah, we could. I could actually also build it here now because they already have the AI agents keep.
Like capabilities so last basically why I was suggesting anything because it was it. This is the one that has the like the AI agent like.
Design like it has like a particular brain that we can we can access to and then it will know what tool to choose to pick or choose from if that makes sense so on.

Peter Wolf   18:12
Well, it kind of, it kind of does, but I'm still, I'm struggling with this part about that originally. OK, so maybe I'm also not making myself clear and and and I do have differing objectives here, but the first objective was truly.
That I would be in ChatGPT and I would be talking to it and I want to initiate something from there, right? Not some other tool. Because if I'm if I use Telegram then I'm calling the standard API to ChatGPT and.

Lem   18:29
OK.
OK.
OK.
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   18:43
What I'm saying is I would be in my ChatGPT, right? My ChatGPT. And that's where the difference is. That's where I'm saying the difference is. If I'm in my ChatGPT, that's my history, my memory, my docs, my projects, my custom GPT's, all that stuff. Then I'm starting from something different. I'm not just calling the.

Lem   18:46
Oh, right. Yeah. Yeah, I think, um, yeah, um.
Yep.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   19:03
Generic ChatGPT and using the API, I'm using the one that already understands me and has a better context for me and then I'm pushing that information out. That was the original reason and that's where I still see value because that's different than going to the just generic API. It doesn't know me.

Lem   19:10
Oh, OK, yeah.
Um.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   19:23
It doesn't have my or from Claude, let's say, because I have a project in Claude that has a definition of my professional history, my jobs, my work, my projects, my clients. It has all that stuff. So when I'm talking to it, I don't have to load that up every time in the API to say, here's who I am. It already knows who I am and I just worry.

Lem   19:30
Yep.
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   19:44
Talking the new stuff, right? So that's why the N8M1 makes sense to me. But when you start talking about putting Telegram in there, I'm not working with my with my ChatGPT then I'm working with the generic ChatGPT through an API, right?
That's what you're saying if I use Telegram, because really you're saying Telegram would be the front end of I'm just talking to some tool that's then calling, that's then calling the API to ChatGPT, not my ChatGPT, but the standard.

Lem   20:00
E uh.
Yeah, it will.
Yep, that's right.
Yep. The generic one. Yep, that's right. The yeah, Yep.

Peter Wolf   20:15
Global accessible, right? That's the difference. That's what I'm saying. So the one you're talking about here with putting Telegram in that fits with my model of saying I want to build an app, a front end app. That's OK, I'm going to do that, right? But right now what I want is I want the one where I'm in my chat CBT. I'm initiating.
From my ChatGPT. OK, yeah.

Lem   20:36
Oh OK from your chat. Yeah yeah I think on the paid plan ChatGPT already has the like we can add here some like API.
On.

Peter Wolf   20:52
No, I definitely have that. We have the API because Brian set it up. Remember, we got one thing to go across like the name, but as soon as we tried to expand it, it wouldn't work. And that's where we got you engaged. And then you said, hey, it doesn't really work this way, right? And then it doesn't have a good connection to make.

Lem   20:52
Oh, I think, um, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   21:02
Yeah, it just it doesn't put enough information through.
Well, that was GPTI don't know about, or at least open AAI.

Peter Wolf   21:13
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, that's CBD, but.

Bryan Wolf   21:17
It's 'cause they have like a they have like a security thing where they don't want to release, you know, X amount of data. So they have that set up like that to where you can't really, you know, transfer information directly like through actually chat to BT like that.

Peter Wolf   21:30
And I don't think that was the. Well, so you were saying we could do that. I just want to make sure, Len, hold on, make sure we're again, that we're clear. I'm saying we're talking about a couple different things. One, you're talking about an AI agent that has a brain that can say, oh, go to Google Docs, go to Google Sheets, go to this app, go to this tool. It knows how to.

Lem   21:31
Yeah, yeah, but but I think.
Yep.
Yes, that's right. Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   21:49
Routed. OK, I like that. That still could be there, but that's going to be called from me talking to my ChatGPT, then goes out to NAN and says, OK, now I want to create a doc or I want to create a spreadsheet. That part we can still have the AI agent, but the initiation is going to come from me talking to my ChatGPT.

Lem   21:57
Oh, I see.
From Chatchapedia, right? Yep.

Peter Wolf   22:09
Yeah. And then pushing out to that AI agent, which can then route it appropriately, OK.

Lem   22:12
Oh, OK.
Oh, OK. Yeah, I see. Yeah. Yeah. I think we could route it. Yeah. Basically the the this one would be coming from your ChatGPT interface. Yeah, that's the. Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   22:24
Yes, correct. Yes, yes, yes.

Lem   22:31
I think we could, yeah, we could access it through the.
Not sure if ChatGPT has the tools to like even like just call the it, but yeah basically I will.

Bryan Wolf   22:48
I think it's for like for custom. If you make a custom GPJ then you can, you know, uh, that's.

Lem   22:51
But.
Yeah, yeah, the costume.

Peter Wolf   22:53
Yeah, that's what it is. You make a you make a custom GPT that would have an API call to it.

Lem   22:59
Yep, that's right. Yeah, yeah, I'll, I'll research more on this one. So I'm not sure if we could build it here on the the playground.

Bryan Wolf   23:00
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   23:08
Well, have you ever just ask, have you ever done the custom GPT that then had the API 'cause we have one built?

Lem   23:14
Uh.
Not yet. Not the custom ChatGPT so.

Peter Wolf   23:18
Yeah, Brian, can you? You could also just give him access to.

Bryan Wolf   23:21
Let me see.

Lem   23:23
OK.

Peter Wolf   23:24
To to our ChatGPT. Can you pull it up right?

Bryan Wolf   23:25
Oh.
Let me see. I'm looking right now.
I'll even know if it's.

Peter Wolf   23:43
And Brad, that one's that that account has my STS one Gmail, right? So that's that's very specific to this thing. You could give him that that that account, my chat GVT, my chat GVT is assigned.

Bryan Wolf   23:53
What do you mean your STS one?
So I don't have a custom GPT that is set up to 'cause I let me just see it back there. No. Yeah, but it didn't work. It didn't work. So I scrapped it. I have.

Peter Wolf   24:03
How? Because you were playing with that, remember?
I know, but you at least oh, what the hell do you throw it away for? It's like.

Bryan Wolf   24:13
Well, I mean, it's it's not hard. It takes all of five seconds to really make it. But I have my writing assistant here. Let me edit GPTI kind of forget it's so it's in the actions. It's in the actions section.

Peter Wolf   24:30
Is this you, Sharon, or this is Lem Sharon? This is Lem Sharon.

Bryan Wolf   24:32
No, this is. I don't have. I don't. I show here.

Lem   24:33
OK.

Bryan Wolf   24:42
So what happens is.
You go here, right? You know, you put all your base information there. You get a picture, you give it instructions, you give it knowledge, right? So yeah, this is, this is, this is custom GPT. This is custom GPT, right? So.

Peter Wolf   24:49
Yes, this is a custom. Yeah, this is a custom GPT in configuration, yeah.

Lem   24:57
OK.

Peter Wolf   24:59
So you create a custom GBT, you give it instructions on what it is, then you can load documents.

Bryan Wolf   25:00
And so.

Lem   25:04
Yep, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   25:04
It's really easy. It asks for a name, description, instructions on what to do. Then you put in the knowledge base that you want it to pull from. So it's gonna pull from this documents and then it's also pulling from its own just chat GPTS knowledge, right? And then in here when you go to create an action, this is where you type in your.

Lem   25:13
OK.

Bryan Wolf   25:24
Code right? You're getting a code right? But it has a problem where if you if you want to import the API with like a URL, it doesn't recognize it. There's some sort of glitch or issue in this where ChatGPT would have to offer more of their like data publicly or like to other companies.

Peter Wolf   25:25
Your API, Your API took it.

Lem   25:37
Yeah, you're good to for the actions.

Bryan Wolf   25:44
In order to be able to communicate freely at a high level with whatever app or, you know, website it's trying to speak with. So for here, like you can add JSON or Skem, I think you can even change this to be JSON. But if you want to add like any sort of URL or like an API key, it's just not going to work. It might work.

Peter Wolf   26:03
As you don't.

Bryan Wolf   26:04
To get through like one small bit of data through, but other than that it's not gonna do anything.

Lem   26:10
I see.

Peter Wolf   26:11
I'll tell you what. So obviously we don't have something for you to sample. I think if you do some research on this, you'll you'll be able to build that custom GBT and and figure it out pretty quickly that part and then yeah, drill into it, see what you come up with. But that's what I'm looking to do. Let's let's try and get it where I'm talking to my ChatGPT, my custom.

Bryan Wolf   26:15
Yeah.

Lem   26:17
Yeah.
Yeah, OK.

Peter Wolf   26:31
GPT, right. And that it's going to have an API. That API will call to that agent, right to N8N and it'll go to a to a, you know, AI agent that will do the routing or figure out the logic because that sounds very robust at that point. Then you could have it do a whole bunch of different things, right? We figure out what we want it to do, but that's the kind of.

Lem   26:33
Yep.
OK.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So yeah, because for this tool, we could actually add more tools here, but some are saying that.

Peter Wolf   26:51
Idea there, right?
Can you go back to sharing? I don't see you're not sharing right now.

Lem   27:00
Oh, right. Uh, let me just uh.
Yeah, so we could actually add here like 10 tools with different different functionalities. But basically the yeah, the one the the main challenge for me is yeah, I would research on how to connect this one. Yeah, for your chat GPD and then it.

Peter Wolf   27:12
Yeah, yeah.
Yep.
Get from my Yeah, from my chat GPD. And then later on we could say we'll put an app there or we'll put something else there. But right now I want it to be my chat GPD, yeah.

Lem   27:27
It was sent.
Yep.
Yeah, then it will send also like the like the document link or something. So that would be, yeah, the like the.

Peter Wolf   27:37
Cut.
Yeah, I like that. So building that again to me the the AI agent part would be potentially reusable to whatever else front end we want, right. We could have different front end be my, yeah, so that that would work. That'd be all usable, reusable content. So I like that.

Lem   27:50
Yeah, that's right. Yep. Yeah.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   27:57
Alright, so if you could work on that stuff, that'd be great, right?

Lem   27:57
Uh, yeah.
OK, Yep.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   28:04
So I think I was, I wasn't going to make Brian work today given it's a holiday for us, Lynn. But if you obviously, if you could work on that stuff and then for whatever time you still have remaining today. And I mean, Brian, I don't know if you want to stay on with him or not, but I'm going to drop off and that's that's what I want to build next though, Lynn.

Lem   28:09
Oh, OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   28:24
Move forward that and I like that with the AI agent stuff. I think that'll be interesting stuff to learn. And then Bri, you'll have to, you'll have to learn on N8N, right? But I think it's another good, another good foundation for you, for your, you know, for your resume, for your experience and stuff.

Bryan Wolf   28:33
Yeah, which is fine.
I've got a little bit of I've Nick's. I've worked a little bit on it, so I'm not completely, but yeah, great.

Peter Wolf   28:43
OK.

Lem   28:45
OK.

Bryan Wolf   28:47
I'm gonna drop off too long.

Lem   28:47
Um, all right. OK, Peter. OK, talk to you soon.

Peter Wolf   28:48
Alright, I appreciate. I'm gonna drop off. Appreciate it then. Talk to you later. I'll be back. Bye.

Lem   28:54
OK. Bye. Bye.

Bryan Wolf   28:57
Lem, I'm gonna drop off too. Even though I love you, Lem, I'm gonna. I'm gonna drop off too.

Lem   28:59
OK.
OK, yeah, no problem. Yeah, I'll, I'll just do some research about this. Yeah, on the in the chat.

Bryan Wolf   29:07
Yeah. So listen, I I think what he's asking for is a lot. I don't think, I don't think you can really like call from Chachi BT to to NAN that easily. That's that's at least through my experience like that was this is that's what we first started doing with this whole thing like just directly calling from Chachi.
BT itself. So I don't know. Best of luck. But uh, yeah, I think it's.

Lem   29:28
OK.
Yeah, because yeah, we would need also it to like feed it back. So basically because I I just have some experience on just inputting data, but not really like.

Bryan Wolf   29:44
Yeah.

Lem   29:45
Because, yeah, there would be like two way on two way. Yeah, basically. But yeah, I'll just.

Bryan Wolf   29:50
Yeah, you know, I'll be honest with you. I I I if you could figure it out, it's amazing. But I'll be honest with you, I I don't think it's it's gonna be for at least from my personal experience that hasn't worked out for me, you know, with with Open AI and all that other stuff, but.

Lem   29:54
I just uh.
Yep.
OK, yeah, but for your your custom chat GPTS, it's just for like creating or it also like pulls out like the document and stuff or it's just it?

Bryan Wolf   30:08
Mhm.
So what do you mean? What do we? What do you mean?

Lem   30:16
Um, basically you fed it all like the persona and like the files, right? But.
The like the files right but.

Bryan Wolf   30:21
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So like, you know, you you, you put in your own, you can put in any of your own documents. And like for me, the one that I have is, is, is, you know, to help me with the writing persona, right. So really I put in like Peter's persona and just kind of tweaked it to to tailor towards me more and I gave it other information.

Lem   30:27
Yep.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   30:41
You know, whatever documents I have, and then it'll pull from that knowledge base first. And it's also better for like, you know, if you want to include specific critical data that maybe ChatGBT wouldn't already have access to, so.

Lem   30:46
Yeah. Oh, OK. Yeah.
Yep, that's it. But it's just for like text, text. What do you call that? Like text creation, right? Like a link creating LinkedIn post. Yeah, basically, yeah, because.

Bryan Wolf   31:00
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just yes.
Yes, but when you when you try to do the the scam the code it just it it like I remember we the for the name testing our first flow or like our first automation it only got one category through and then when you try to do more it it has this glitch where there's.
There's supposed to be an option in the custom GBTS where you can like change from Skemna to a different option. I I can't remember this but it's like not there. Like something's wrong with the with the ChatGPT or like I don't know it's it's they're just outdated or at least for me like to to actually.

Lem   31:31
OK.
Oh, I see. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   31:46
Use it to to use an API or even like JSON or Scrivnut to communicate with another app. It just is really poor. It's really poor.

Lem   31:52
Yeah, that's true. Oh, OK, yeah, I'll, I'll look into it and yeah, I'll research it more on.

Bryan Wolf   31:59
Yeah, yeah. Best of luck, Lam. Seriously.

Lem   32:01
First on the weekend. OK. Hey, thanks, Brian. OK. OK. Talk to you soon. See ya. OK. Bye. Bye.

Bryan Wolf   32:05
Yeah, alright, I'll talk to you Monday, alright.
Hey, Rob. Bye.
