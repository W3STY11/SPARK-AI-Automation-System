Lem   0:05
Yeah, no problem.

Bryan Wolf   0:05
OK.
Hold on. Let me just fix this real.

Lem   0:20
Yep. Peter wanted to talk also a while ago, but yeah, I was also having a meeting with my other client to troubleshoot some stuff, but yeah.

Bryan Wolf   0:31
I emailed you.

Lem   0:33
No, no, Peter, just chat me on upper like 2 hours ago. This was, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   0:39
Yeah.

Lem   0:45
I wanted some updates on the newsletter, but I wasn't able to.
He has some call also, right this this time also.

Bryan Wolf   0:55
Yeah, he's he's almo right now. I think it's just us this morning.
He might come in a little later, but I think it's just me and you.

Lem   0:59
Yeah. OK. OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:00
It's just good.
We can just knockout.
I don't really have much to work on, but let me just get some water and then we'll jump into it.

Lem   1:08
OK.
No problem.

Bryan Wolf   1:46
Alright so.
I know my e-mail.

Lem   1:50
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:50
I sent you.
I sent it later night.
It probably wasn't the best, you know, very descriptive of, but so there's a couple things I wanna try and do today.
I wanna fix.
Make sure 'cause Peter's Senior's newsletter is really almost firing.
It's just at that last two steps where Revo doesn't send it to the e-mail.

Lem   2:12
OK.

Bryan Wolf   2:14
So I wanna figure that out and then also.
So I I wanna see if we are able to. If you are able to help me.
Make it to that home.
Let me just pull this up. Make it so that in the Google doc for the LinkedIn Post and for the newsletter that when we is there anyway we can set it up so that when it creates the Google Doc then it puts it into a folder because my.

Lem   2:30
OK.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   2:40
My Google Docs is just it's getting swarmed with articles which I don't mind.
But it just it gets too much when I'm like say I'm trying to do something else. I'm looking for something else that's not related to this.

Lem   2:51
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   2:53
It's gonna be hard to find so.

Lem   2:54
Yeah, we could.
Actually, it's much better to set it up that way.

Bryan Wolf   2:59
Yeah.

Lem   3:00
Yeah, we could do that.

Bryan Wolf   3:02
Alright, pull.
Let me just pull all my stuff up here.
How you doing?

Lem   3:07
Yeah, good, good. Quite busy.

Bryan Wolf   3:10
Quite busy.
Quite busy, huh?

Lem   3:11
Yeah. Yeah, quite busy. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   3:14
Do you have another call today?
Like later.

Lem   3:17
Yeah, we would have another call later because I'm some troubleshooting, some stuff that I've built also and yeah, and yeah, we we would need to continually later again after our call. So yeah.

Bryan Wolf   3:25
Yeah.
That's OK, I think.
I think we can knock everything out by the time you you you know, you gotta get off.

Lem   3:36
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   3:38
But so let me see.
Let me look at my scenarios here.
So I'm pull my brevo.
Oh, I gotta sign for Peter.
So actually.

Lem   3:52
Yeah, for yeah, for the brevo. Peter also would need to sign up because you can't like.

Bryan Wolf   3:57
Well, I signed him up.
I I made him an account.

Lem   4:01
OK here.

Bryan Wolf   4:01
And.
This is what I'm saying. Like I think I did everything right.
It's still not working, so let me just show you.

Lem   4:08
OK.

Bryan Wolf   4:11
What's up?
Oh man.
Huh. Is this what I worked on yesterday?
This is not what I worked on.
One second, lemme. I'm sorry.

Lem   4:44
Yeah. OK.
No problem.
No.

Bryan Wolf   5:01
OK.
Here we go.
Yeah. So can you hear me alright, 'cause? I don't have my. My headset's broken. I think I just wanna make sure you can hear. OK, so let me just.
Pull up all the stuff.
I'm sorry I'm taking forever right now.
No.
Yeah.
Master.
OK so.
****. Alright, so I'm just gonna share so.
So look, in the scenario, I think it's three.

Lem   5:57
OK.

Bryan Wolf   6:01
Yes. So in here I create Lizzo and put the API key in there, right? And this sender.
I was able to pick from a drop down menu before I was just trying to delete it and type it in, but I got to work and everything else is good, you know.

Lem   6:15
OK.

Bryan Wolf   6:19
You're first. I've got all the other emails.

Lem   6:19
Uh.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   6:22
Set up in here.

Lem   6:24
That's for that. Yeah. OK.

Bryan Wolf   6:27
So that way.

Lem   6:28
And this one.

Bryan Wolf   6:29
So let me just try and shoot it first.
Let me just see show you how it doesn't work.

Lem   6:33
Create a e-mail compare.

Bryan Wolf   6:33
So let's just go to.
OK.
Uh huh.

Lem   7:22
OK.
Oh, that's the it's iterating.

Bryan Wolf   7:30
Yeah.

Lem   7:37
Yeah, I think that's good top three.
And then.

Bryan Wolf   7:41
Very soon.
Oh well, this didn't pop here.
So this.

Lem   7:49
OK.
OK. And then?

Bryan Wolf   7:55
Usually it's quick with this.

Lem   7:57
Thank you.
Yeah, it was already turned on right the.

Bryan Wolf   8:06
No, no, no.

Lem   8:07
Second, the automation in make.
Or.

Bryan Wolf   8:15
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   8:17
The number? Yeah. #2I.
Oh, it's not triggering.
That's odd.
Have you set up the Google Apps script on this spreadsheet or?

Bryan Wolf   8:36
Yeah.

Lem   8:38
OK.

Bryan Wolf   8:41
Yeah, I'll put in the new ones.

Lem   8:42
And then the trigger.
Can we check the?
On the left side on the.
On the Google Apps script.
And Yep, this one and then.
On on edit on edit trigger.
Yep, this is good.

Bryan Wolf   9:03
So yesterday it would.
It would even get this done.
It would get this part done.
I don't know why it's not done now. If we get that done and then I would get here and I would press yes and it wouldn't send.
And then when I go to my brevo and I go to transactional.
And I go to logs.

Lem   9:21
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   9:22
It wouldn't even show up here.
It doesn't even show up.

Lem   9:25
Yeah. So I think it was.
It was. It's not.
Being sent for the, but yeah, I think this is not triggering.
Also, I'm not sure.
Or maybe there's there's there's some delay. Can you go back to the scenarios and?

Bryan Wolf   9:38
Should I try and do a 1 by 1?
Turn off.

Lem   9:48
It's already on, right?
Can we double check the web books for the number 2?
So yeah, the number 2.

Bryan Wolf   9:53
Yeah.

Lem   9:56
Yeah, this one.
It's X2K42.
So let's check.
X2K42 on.
Yeah, the apps script.
It should be on the HI think.
Yeah, it's it's still different.

Bryan Wolf   10:16
Is it?
Oh man, I thought I got that right.

Lem   10:18
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So we we would need to, yeah, manually copy it for the three web books.

Bryan Wolf   10:28
Listen, Lam. I'm gonna bet my life that the rest of them are right.

Lem   10:28
And.
OK. Yeah.
This aaus. Yeah, let's check the other one.

Bryan Wolf   10:44
Oh my God, it's wrong.

Lem   10:45
Oh yeah, it's it's different.
It's still, I think I you. You edited the. Oh, maybe you edited it and you didn't click the save.

Bryan Wolf   10:48
No, I thought I did this.
I didn't press save. Yeah, definitely.

Lem   10:56
So yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, you haven't pressed the save button.

Bryan Wolf   10:59
So what is there a save at the bottom or something? Alright. ****.

Lem   11:02
Yep. So I think that's yeah, that that's why I didn't change.

Bryan Wolf   11:10
I was so sure I got that part right.

Lem   11:13
Yeah. Yeah. But I think you didn't just pick the save button.
That's why I didn't. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   11:18
Yeah.
OK.

Lem   11:22
And.

Bryan Wolf   11:24
Now is this the save button?

Lem   11:26
I know the one on the like disk beside the run button on yeah this one.

Bryan Wolf   11:30
Ah, you're right. Right, right, right, right, right, right.

Lem   11:31
Yeah, that one.
Yeah, that's the that was the save button.

Bryan Wolf   11:34
Damn it. OK.

Lem   11:36
Yep. So yeah, I think.
Yeah, this would work now so.
Just remove the yes first.

Bryan Wolf   11:47
Can I just do it again from here? Or I gotta fire it again?

Lem   11:51
Yeah, you can actually do it from the spreadsheet because it's already turned on, so that would actually add that would now, yeah, that would now work.

Bryan Wolf   11:56
Yeah.

Lem   12:02
Yep. So now it's good.
And then you should get the next letter drops, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   12:10
It's gonna take a minute.
These ones take a little bit of time.

Lem   12:13
Yeah, yeah, it's it's already creating the like the content.

Bryan Wolf   12:18
The documents, yeah.

Lem   12:19
Yeah, the text content in document. But yeah, we could actually set the document up that it will be created on a folder so that your drive won't be, yeah, won't be spammed by the content, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   12:29
Right.
Yeah, yeah. Overpopulate 'cause. If you look well, this is this is just my. This is Peter's. If we went on mine, it would be like there's a billion in there. I gotta.

Lem   12:41
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   12:44
I don't even know how to create a folder in there.
That's I was like looking at I can.

Lem   12:47
Now we could.
Now we could do that later if.

Bryan Wolf   12:51
Yeah, yeah. I want to do it for the LinkedIn one too.

Lem   12:55
For the for the linking 1.

Bryan Wolf   12:58
For for.

Lem   12:59
Yeah, for the LinkedIn.

Bryan Wolf   13:01
Yeah, for a friend.

Lem   13:01
Yeah, for the LinkedIn.

Bryan Wolf   13:02
For the posting on LinkedIn.
I had to log out of this stuff.
So see, it's still taking awhile.

Lem   13:10
Can we check the? Yeah, it's actually taking awhile.
The number? Yeah. #3.

Bryan Wolf   13:15
3.
Oh, I didn't have two on.
Here.
Should you check bravo?
Or no. Bravo, send it to me. This is 3.

Lem   13:30
That's number three, right?
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   13:36
Maybe 2?

Lem   13:38
Oh yeah, the number.
How can we go back?
I think that there's an error there.
Yeah. Can you go back to your? No. Yeah, it's actually stopped then.

Bryan Wolf   13:43
So I didn't have two one.

Lem   13:51
Can you K?

Bryan Wolf   13:51
I think that I I need the song I 'cause look create Google DOC newsletter. I didn't have that.
I didn't have this on.
That's why.
I think.

Lem   14:05
Yeah, but it actually send the process, so it passed through a while ago, but there's an error there.
Can we go back to the?
Yeah, I think it would error out again.
I will.
Let's yeah, this one.
And then it, oh, the I think, yeah, the yeah. The newsletter draft has a different different.
No, I think it it, it was not mapped correctly because it has like a user denied.
So let's just go back to the.

Bryan Wolf   14:46
But I didn't do the right thing on there.

Lem   14:48
I think.

Bryan Wolf   14:50
You're right, spreadsheet ID is wrong.

Lem   14:52
Yeah. So that's bradshot ideas.
And then yeah, we could now see, just save it and then you could actually trigger it manually.
In the no. On the web hook. So there's actually can see there if you go back, just click save and then save that scenario and then go back.
Yeah, there. OK. As you can see, there's like that one. No, go back.
Yeah. Go back on the number two scenario.
Yeah, yeah, that one.
So there's like Violet. Yeah, this one.
So there are two records in the queue waiting to be processed.
So when when something aired out so it like mix scenario pause the scenario and then we could actually data is also still being.

Bryan Wolf   15:36
Mm hmm.
In there. So ugly.

Lem   15:42
Yeah, in their pass through. But yeah, we could actually manually like trigger the.

Bryan Wolf   15:45
Yeah.

Lem   15:48
The flow with that particular data. So yeah, just go to the diagram and.

Bryan Wolf   15:54
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just run it.

Lem   15:59
Yeah. And then just run it again.
Why use existing data?
Yeah. So this would process the the first, yes that you click. So it actually triggered the web book.
But yeah, it aired out a while ago, but yeah, this is yeah. This is basically doing the and then after this one if.

Bryan Wolf   16:14
OK.
So on on this page on this.
On #2 on this scenario, what page of this is that that is that?

Lem   16:26
OK.

Bryan Wolf   16:28
That's this one, right?
Like.

Lem   16:31
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the.

Bryan Wolf   16:33
There it's it's. Yeah.

Lem   16:35
Yeah, this.
Yeah, this is actually coming from here, #2.
So whenever you click the click the yes.

Bryan Wolf   16:40
Yeah.

Lem   16:41
So this will web book will trigger. So you could actually change the web book so that it you won't be get you. Yeah, it won't be confusing like.

Bryan Wolf   16:44
Mm hmm.

Lem   16:53
Triggered and.

Bryan Wolf   16:53
I just wanna know what scenario correlates with like what page?
That way I know if I have a problem on this page I know like oh it's on scenario three, scenario 4.

Lem   17:04
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah. So basically the yeah, the the Tab 2 there it's for the number two and then the number three automation is for the.
The the next like flow.
So.

Bryan Wolf   17:20
Right, right, right, right.

Lem   17:22
Like then, yeah, this one.
The first first final is OK so.

Bryan Wolf   17:24
Here we go. So we got one.

Lem   17:29
And then.

Bryan Wolf   17:32
See what I'm saying like this?

Lem   17:32
Yeah. So this is like.

Bryan Wolf   17:33
This is too many Google Docs, but so let's yes.

Lem   17:37
OK.
So it should.
Yeah, it should send the test e-mail for this one.
So we could actually.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   17:52
This is where the brevo gets involved though.
No logs.

Lem   18:05
Can you go back to the?
Scenario on make and the make scenarios. Yeah it already.

Bryan Wolf   18:12
Yes.

Lem   18:13
Yeah. Is this?
Is that the one?
I think it sent the e-mail.

Bryan Wolf   18:15
No, I think it's it is.
It is. It is.

Lem   18:18
OK, OK.

Bryan Wolf   18:19
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Lem   18:19
Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   18:21
There we go.
See OK.
All right.
So then we just, let's see if we can get the final one done.
I'm sure it'll do it.

Lem   18:26
Yep, so.
Yes. So I think, yeah, the yeah, basically I think it didn't work awhile ago because like the web books was not the web book.
Yeah, the web book URL was not set up properly, so I think that's the main issue there, but I think this will already.
Work properly.

Bryan Wolf   18:49
Right.

Lem   18:51
I actually already also finished the.
The customized, like the inbox, the one that I like the inbox filter.

Bryan Wolf   19:02
Well, the what?
The the new what filter?
So here I'm gonna this is Peter. So I'm gonna go online and we can start working on mine. 'cause. This is all good.

Lem   19:11
OK. I yeah, you can just take off the on there on the number two scenario because it's actually turned off.

Bryan Wolf   19:20
Well, I don't really need lawn. You know, I'm gonna turn 'cause now.

Like the image.

Bryan Wolf   22:46

Lem   22:50
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   22:50
So like I got I got newsletter here and then I have this one here the research one.

Lem   22:56
Yeah. So this one is the old one.
So I've tweaked this to be like it so that it would go together with the.

Bryan Wolf   23:05
So I can.
I can really get rid of. This is what you're saying?

Lem   23:10
Yeah, if you want to, you could.
Yeah, get rid of that, but yeah.

Bryan Wolf   23:12
Well, I'm not gonna.
I'm just saying like it's it's the newer version of it.
You know what you're saying?

Lem   23:15
Yes. Then you were you were version and just the like the Google sheet, the last module for the Google sheet. There should also be mapped to the newsletter flow database.
So yeah, that would be.

Bryan Wolf   23:30
Oh wait, so which one?
Which which gushet is this connected to?
I'm not doing a.

Lem   23:37
It should be connected to the newsletter, the one.

Bryan Wolf   23:41
Oh really?

Lem   23:42
Yeah. So it will put it on the filtered articles.

Bryan Wolf   23:47
Uh huh.

Bryan Wolf   23:51
Ah, OK.
OK. OK. OK.

Lem   23:54
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   23:56
So if I find an article interesting and I e-mail it to myself.

Lem   23:56
So.
Yeah, that's right.
This will trigger and then it will pick up that e-mail then create us.

Bryan Wolf   24:04
It'll put it in here.

Lem   24:05
Yeah, that one. It will put there. And then I've added.

Bryan Wolf   24:07
OK, great.

Lem   24:08
I've actually added there another column which is source after the status, so there would be like source.

Bryan Wolf   24:15
Where in in OK, in a new Google sheet.
So I should put it right here.

Lem   24:20
You can just add it.
Yeah, just put source and then I've already put it there. That it will populate here if it's coming from ChatGPT filtered and then if it's coming to the Gmail inbox filter.
So yeah, that, that that's all right.

Bryan Wolf   24:33
So I'm not very good. OK, so now this I don't.
It'll be good right here like this, right?

Lem   24:38
Yeah, it would be good.
Yeah, it's it's already OK.

Bryan Wolf   24:40
OK.

Lem   24:43
But yeah, you will need to like map it this again to all of the credentials, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   24:43
OK.
So let me just finish.
That's OK.
Oh wait.
From now on.

Lem   24:53
Yeah. Yeah, just from now on. Because yeah, from now on, then, yeah, for the.

Bryan Wolf   24:55
Or even OK.

Lem   25:01
So yeah, for this one you could just send yourself an e-mail then newsletter plus and then it will.
Yeah, this would.
This should pick it up and then.
The thing is here it would be better if it should. It would be a web book.
But yeah, I'm Gmail is pretty.

Bryan Wolf   25:22
It's it's uptight, huh?

Lem   25:23
It's. Yeah. It's uptight on that.

Lem   26:17
The.

Bryan Wolf   26:19
I gotta learn 'cause. I think I can.
I I could start to build a flow, but these tools like the UUID. What is the UUID?

Lem   26:25
Yep.
Yeah, the UUID is just like a unique identifier for.
For referencing it, the particular data in the future because yeah, we.

Bryan Wolf   26:40
OK.
You're talking about like this stuff like these.

Lem   26:46
No on the.
So basically the logic here is we're assigning that particular UUID to the article, so that in the future, if you want to reference that article, we could just pull out the UUID and then we could get the data from that article, like the title, the summary so does.

Bryan Wolf   27:01
Mm hmm.
Right, yeah.

Lem   27:06
That make sense?
Yeah. So it's it's just a unique identifier for.
Yeah. For the particular data.
But you you won't be needing to use this depending on it would just depend on the use case.
But yeah, there are like tools.
Yeah, there that because there's like thousands.
No, not not thousands, but I I think.

Bryan Wolf   27:26
But yeah, I got what you're saying.

Lem   27:27
Yeah, like like 30 to 40 tools on make, so.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   27:37
Turn my skin.

Lem   27:38
But basically the important thing here also is like the manipulation of the data like.
Reading the inputs and outputs, yeah, something like that for.
Also for troubleshooting stuff.

Bryan Wolf   27:54
Yeah.

Lem   27:55
But yeah, so basically what you could actually also do is if you want to build a system.

Bryan Wolf   27:56
This is.

Lem   28:00
So just like draw the logic first on a like a notebook or on figma.

Bryan Wolf   28:06
Really. OK.

Lem   28:07
Also VMC, Cal.

Bryan Wolf   28:07
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   28:08
Yeah. Then so that, yeah, that's actually what I do.

Bryan Wolf   28:09
Is that what you do?

Lem   28:12
And then just I'll just map like the system on like the step by step and then I will check the API endpoints if if it's possible.

Bryan Wolf   28:13
Wow.
Yeah.

Lem   28:21
So because sometimes there are like API endpoints that are not.
That doesn't have or.
Yeah, they don't offer that endpoint to the particular platform.
So that would be also a.
Like.
A A problem?
So yeah, basically that's how I scope the the.
Yeah, the automation, the workflow.

Bryan Wolf   28:44
OK.
That's interesting. That's interesting.

Lem   28:46
Yeah. So I I don't actually build it like like 1 by 1.
So I first map out the like outline the like the system.

Bryan Wolf   28:55
The whole thing, like a rough draft, almost.

Lem   28:56
Yeah, the how, how, how it would.
Yeah, like a rough draft.
And then yeah, I'll basically, I'll check again next if the API endpoints is possible so.
Yeah, that's.

Bryan Wolf   29:11
OK, look, so I just, I sent me.
I sent myself an e-mail.
I said research.
I have this on.

Lem   29:19
Yeah, I think that.
Yeah, I changed the trigger to newsletter plus because Peter said like newsletter plus.

Bryan Wolf   29:26
Oh, so that's what I gotta.
I gotta type that in instead of research.
Then what do you mean?

Lem   29:29
Is this the?
Yeah, I I actually didn't change the name yet.
It should be newsletter plus.
So can you just change the name here?
The title of the Yeah. There. Yeah, you can edit it there. Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   29:39
Yeah. How do I.
How do I change in it?
Oh, so the whole thing I just named a newsletter plus.

Lem   29:47
No, just the new trigger research.
So just change the research to yeah, that one, the research to newsletter plus so that it won't.
It's easier to reference newsletter, one word newsletter plus just one word newsletter plus.

Bryan Wolf   29:59
One word, 2 words, one word or two words.
Thanks, love.

Lem   30:11
I let me just check.

Bryan Wolf   30:14
Or like this you're saying like this?

Lem   30:16
Yeah, that that like that.
Yeah. Newsletter plus so.

Bryan Wolf   30:18
So this does this matter?
This is capital or no.

Lem   30:21
No, it doesn't matter if it's capital.
But yeah, it should be one word because I've added.

Bryan Wolf   30:24
OK.
Yeah. OK.
So let's do this here.

Lem   30:30
Yeah, just copy it. So I actually.
Designed also the system that you can add here the website and image source, because perplexity is having a hard time getting the image, but I've added also a fall back which is the.

Bryan Wolf   30:46
OK.

Lem   30:49
The unsplash. So if there's no image source here on the e-mail that you.

Bryan Wolf   30:53
Right, it'll do it itself.

Lem   30:55
Yeah, it will just get from Unsplash, so.
OK.
Then yeah, this manually.

Bryan Wolf   31:05
It's already run out.

Lem   31:08
Yeah, just manually trigger the. Yeah, yeah, we this should because this is appalling. Trigger. So appalling. Trigger is like running every intervals and then yeah, it's different than the the web hook.

Bryan Wolf   31:08
It's not.
So I'll have to mainly trigger this one instead of keeping it running. Is what you're saying.

Lem   31:29
Yeah. Or we could.
We could set it up that it runs every 15 minutes, so you would still need.

Bryan Wolf   31:35
Yeah.

Lem   31:36
Yeah, we took 15 minutes, so it's much better to like, run it on demand if.

Bryan Wolf   31:40
Ah, that's great.

Lem   31:43
So yeah.

Bryan Wolf   31:43
Let's go land. We got it.
Oh, it says Gmail newsletter. Let's go look.

Lem   31:45
So yeah, yeah.
And you start here.
Yeah, yeah, that's so.

Bryan Wolf   31:50
Yeah.

Lem   31:51
Yeah.
For all right, the other one is for the ChatGPT filter.
You you could just update the last date Google Sheet.

Bryan Wolf   32:02
Which one for for for the one I was just on.

Lem   32:05
Yeah, you could actually move this to the folder.

Bryan Wolf   32:10
For which one?
LinkedIn or or newsletter.
Yeah. Newsletter, huh?

Lem   32:13
Yeah, on the newsletter.
And then you can go to number.
Yeah, yeah, just move it first, OK.
To newsletter OK yeah.
So now this is part of the the the newsletter flow.

Bryan Wolf   32:26
Right.

Lem   32:27
Yeah. And then.
Yeah you could.

Bryan Wolf   32:31
Here this this.
Oh no, you go.
You go tell me.

Lem   32:34
Yeah. So basically you could also update the source from the number 2 so.
Yeah. And then.
On the last spread sheet there on the yeah. Oh, I think this is a different one.
It should be on number one, yeah, on #1.
So on number one, it's.
Yeah. On the last there.
So add to filter and then just refresh it.
There's a refresh button here on table containers, headers on the right side on on the Google Sheets so.
Yeah, below that sheet name.
So.

Bryan Wolf   33:14
I'm sorry I'm slow. I'm sorry.

Lem   33:16
Yeah, table contains headers.
Yeah, that one right side.
Yeah, that's that this one.
So just click refresh and then it will refresh the headers for the spreadsheet and then you can go down to the yeah, no, just Scroll down.
Here. Yeah.
So now there is a source there. As you can see on the J column, yeah. So you can just put.

Bryan Wolf   33:39
So what is this telling me though?
What? What is this telling me?

Lem   33:42
There you can just put here ChatGPT filtered.
So what will happen is whenever there's a new article that is coming here that is filtered by ChatGPT.
So it will also update that particular row with a source which is ChatGPT filtered. So you can just type their ChatGPT.
Or yeah ChatGPT filtered or like coming from chat GP.

Bryan Wolf   34:04
And I'm gonna keep this here permanently, right?

Lem   34:06
Yeah, yeah.
So every time there's a new article, it will also populate that source column, the one that is the new column.
So that you have. Yeah, there.

Bryan Wolf   34:14
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   34:16
So you would see the coming from ChatGPT or coming from.

Bryan Wolf   34:21
Right.

Lem   34:22
Yeah, just that there.
And then.

Bryan Wolf   34:27
And I can put clog in here if I really wanted to, right?

Lem   34:28
Yep.
Just save pardon.

Bryan Wolf   34:32
I could put clog in there if I really wanted to, right?

Lem   34:34
Yeah you could.
Yeah, you could actually put Claude there and and then just add the prompt or add your persona within the. Yeah, that prompt the prompt for that one, and you could like you could also like tweak it a little bit and add the add something there.

Bryan Wolf   34:37
Yeah.
I would just copy exactly what's in here, basically.
Yeah. Yeah, right here.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   34:54
But yeah.

Bryan Wolf   34:54
All right, so listen, now, let's let's let's start with the LinkedIn.
Let's set this up so that we can have.
A folder in here 'cause. I'm gonna show you. I just have.

Lem   35:05
Yep this.
Yeah, this lot of.

Bryan Wolf   35:09
A billion of them, man.
So I I gotta find out how to just consolidate them in in something. I I'm gonna make.

Lem   35:15
Yeah, that's right. So.

Bryan Wolf   35:17
Let's do one for newsletter and for LinkedIn. How that sound OK?

Lem   35:20
Yeah. For Lincoln. Yep. OK.

Bryan Wolf   35:22
So do you know where I would start with that?

Lem   35:24
Yeah. So go to your Google Google Drive on Gmail.
So just go to your Gmail.
Yep, you can also search Google Drive.

Bryan Wolf   35:34
Yeah, I know it's up there.

Lem   35:36
Yeah. And then.

Bryan Wolf   35:36
I'm just.

Lem   35:38
Here and then you can click new and then new folder.
Yeah, that's this one then.
Just. Yeah, name it to LinkedIn. Let's say LinkedIn.
Yeah, LinkedIn articles.
LinkedIn this is like a content post, right? LinkedIn.

Bryan Wolf   36:00
Yeah. This is, yeah, yeah. LinkedIn article folder.

Lem   36:00
Think.
Mainly.

Bryan Wolf   36:05
Let's do LinkedIn articles.

Lem   36:07
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   36:08
It's an article.
Post OK.

Lem   36:13
Then click create OK.

Bryan Wolf   36:14
Great.

Lem   36:16
Yep, so now we can assign that.
Yeah, the one excuse me.
Send it at Google sheet.
So let me let's check it.
Yeah, this is not the one.
So it's on the second one.
You have this one.
Yeah. So this is the one that is creating the folder create document for blog post. Then yeah we could now.

Bryan Wolf   36:44
Add another, add another got Doc.

Lem   36:48
Was just download the file.
Oh, that's a persona.
Yeah. So just click the create document for blog post.
Yeah, this one and then.
New documents location just change this one.
Yeah. Change that one to.

Bryan Wolf   37:06
Oh, so why is it?
Why is it so?
This is pulling my persona or it's it's.

Lem   37:11
No, it's putting the folder actually to BJW persona.
So if you go back to your Google Drive on your BJW persona, there will be.
Yeah, this one there would be.
Yeah, there's there's, like, lots of. Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   37:24
Oh ****.
Oh God.

Lem   37:25
So it was being put there there on the.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   37:30
Wait, so then is there anyway that when I when I look on here?
I guess I just have to do it on my Google Drive.
It'd be better to find stuff on my Google Drive.
Huh.
Like when you look for your documents, you go to Google Drive, not your. Yeah, OK.

Lem   37:47
Yeah, you could like search.

Bryan Wolf   37:48
Looks in here.
Well, so sorry to say.
That's my persona.
So OK, all right.

Lem   37:59
Yeah, we. Yeah, it's it's sending to your persona.
So we we would need to like.

Bryan Wolf   38:06
Can I delete this? Here we go.

Lem   38:08
Yeah.
Yeah, this one and then.

Bryan Wolf   38:11
OK.

Lem   38:14
LinkedIn article post yeah, so yeah, the new documents will be assigned there and then it will be found on the LinkedIn article post. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   38:16
Hmm.
Yeah. OK.
So that's it.
Wow, that was way usually I thought.
Alright, so then then fix it for you, yeah.

Lem   38:25
Yeah.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   38:30
So here's nothing, no nothing.

Lem   38:30
And.
Then.

Bryan Wolf   38:33
No, hold on.
You know what's all right?
Peter's here, Lev.
Yeah, Lem, I'm here.

Lem   38:36
OK.

Bryan Wolf   38:37
Let me see. Brian, you don't want to show how stupid the issue was that he missed.

Lem   38:37
I'll be there.

Bryan Wolf   38:41
He worked all day yesterday, fixed.

Lem   38:43
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   38:43
So then let's do one for this one too, so.
Let me know when I can jump in here and steal the conversation from.
Jose, no, not this one.
Is it get content?

Lem   38:59
This is for.

Bryan Wolf   38:59
'Cause like I I wanna.
I wanna do the same thing for the newsletter.
So that all the newsletters that you see.

Lem   39:06
OK.
Oh yeah, it it's on.

Bryan Wolf   39:12
4.

Lem   39:14
No, I think #3 it's a number. Let me just.

Bryan Wolf   39:15
No.

Lem   39:20
It should no #2.

Bryan Wolf   39:21
Content.

Lem   39:23
Yeah, it's #2 because it's already getting the the content.

Bryan Wolf   39:26
Front.

Lem   39:26
So yeah, it's on the second flow.

Bryan Wolf   39:31
All three of these are Craig. Good to talk to you.

Lem   39:32
And then yeah, yeah, that, that's that's it.
That have you already created the folder?
So yeah, just create a folder 1st and then.

Bryan Wolf   39:39
No.

Lem   39:43
Yeah. Newsletter.
Newsletter documents.
Yeah. And then yeah, we would need to assign it there also.

Bryan Wolf   40:00
I got a lot of **** for a little bit thing.
Nice. OK.

Lem   40:26
Yeah, yeah.
So it would.
Yeah, it would already go to the.
Yeah. Just save. Yeah, save it then.
Yeah. The only thing here is can. Can you go back to the newsletter and then on number that was number 2, right?

Bryan Wolf   40:46
That was that was that was three. No, that was 2.

Lem   40:47
Uh.
Yeah. Can you go to?
Yeah. The number three and the great the get content, so.
Let's just double check if.
Yeah, this one.
Yeah, I think it could get anywhere on the your Google Drive.

Bryan Wolf   41:10
Still still good.

Lem   41:11
Yep, yeah, that's good.

Bryan Wolf   41:13
OK.

Lem   41:13
Yeah, I think that's good. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   41:14
I think I'm good with everything.
I'm good.
So if you wanna.

Lem   41:20
Yeah. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   41:22
Alright, so let here is like can you pull up one of those superhuman AI emails?
It's like a e-mail chain that updates your.
It just gives up like new AI information.
So I think he what he wants to do is.

Lem   41:44
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   41:46
Implement it into.
I think I did. It's not.
Mm hmm.
But for superhuman?
One word superhuman.
There you go.
So Lev, this is what I'm trying to emulate right now.

Lem   42:07
Oh, OK.

Bryan Wolf   42:10
This is not a good one.
It's only that's just saying you're you're signed up.
Reply yes to this mail if you right.

Lem   42:14
OK.
Yeah, this sign up is a sign up. Welcome e-mail, right?

Bryan Wolf   42:21
Yeah.

Lem   42:23
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   42:24
So Lemm did not give you this. Did you see this?
Are you signed up for this?
Look, I can log into your thing, OK?

Lem   42:29
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   42:31
Hold on one SEC.
Does it ask me when you do that?
I'm not gonna use your e-mail buddy.
I know I'm not worried about you. Just makes me nervous when other computers have the same kind of access and it doesn't send me any kind of notification.
It it definitely does though.
Like I didn't see that you just logged in right now, OK.
So here's a great example, right?
This is what I'm trying to emulate.
So I have that insights right that that kind of intro thing, we're gonna have some header, we'll add that header part. That's fine. Scroll down.
Then here's an example.
This structure is the way they do it and and I'm gonna feed a whole bunch of these.
I'm gonna take 1020 of them, feed them into ChatGPT, and ask it to analyze how it's doing this 'cause. I love the structure.
But the first thing it's doing here is they have 123 always.
They're gonna have this 123 and this is going to kind of three articles or three touchpoints, 3 specific things that they're focused on, right.
So, OK, great.
Scroll down a little bit.
Now there's a specific article or topic and and they'll have some blurb here.
Keep going. Then what the have is.
Yes, I'm not sure exactly what this is, but they'll have like from social media. Scroll down a little bit further.
Keep going.
Yeah. So they'll have like from social media, come back up and it it.
Oh no, that's it.
Go down.
It was trending on social media, right, so here.
Now this goes out and they're going out mostly to X, right?
But like what I would like to do is come up with a section like this that's gonna go out to to LinkedIn and to Reddit and to X, and then it will again will have a way to search that.

Lem   44:13
Hmm.

Bryan Wolf   44:26
And pull the content the topics that are critical us we find viral.
Viral posts that are relevant to the topics we want and will include them here.
So what API's?

Lem   44:35
OK.

Bryan Wolf   44:35
Because I know there's an API that I can go and search LinkedIn and find viral topics, and I'm assuming there's the same thing for these others. I want to build those as another input, just like the input from the news feed that we would we would create another.

Lem   44:41
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   44:52
Flow kind of the manual input, the news feed input and then another here that would feed these things in where they.
Be treated exactly the same, right?
Instead of giving a whole little section, they would get one. They would get one sentence with a link, and you know some emoji or some graphic on there, and it would just be a quick, short hit list.

Lem   45:03
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   45:13
So what do you think of that?

Lem   45:15
Yeah, basically it would be like a data scraping flow.
So it will scrape the social media for their posts like this.
So we could use like AP5 for that one.

Bryan Wolf   45:26
Mm hmm.

Lem   45:29
Yeah. And then.

Bryan Wolf   45:30
So is it a?
Is it a scraping or is there an API that like specifically let's you search for LinkedIn viral topics like I have Tulia Tulia Tulio which is? Yeah, I already paid for it and I hardly ever use it now, but because there were things on there like you couldn.

Lem   45:39
Umm.
Twilio.

Bryan Wolf   45:49
Schedule on the regular LinkedIn that has scheduling. It will also pull viral.
Post and, you know, propose them to you on the topics you're talking about.
So I I believe that they must have an API that can go and identify viral, you know, high volume.

Lem   46:06
Umm.

Bryan Wolf   46:09
Reacted to posts that are all on specific topics.

Lem   46:14
Yeah, I think.
Yeah, I think.
Yeah, RSS like I reader also has for now only Facebook pagehip is only for the Facebook page.
But yeah, basically.

Bryan Wolf   46:25
Can we?
Can you do some research to try and find like how would we go about searching again?
I I would say XI would say LinkedIn and Reddit as as as areas where we would want to search, but we'd like to search for very specific.
Again, I want AI in finance or finance topics, so I don't know if we have to figure out certain accounts we follow or.

Lem   46:52
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   46:52
Something like that.
But can you research that to figure out how we could get a flow?
That would let us build a little section like this.

Lem   47:01
Yeah, I have something on my mind basically.
Yeah, it's a scraping flow.
It would involve, so it's also another platform for scraping and then they have their like like scraping for LinkedIn like Reddit. Also for all social media also for like websites and stuff.

Bryan Wolf   47:13
Uh huh.
And what you put in your search criteria.

Lem   47:23
Yeah, you would. Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   47:23
Like we say, what the topics are and then it figures out which ones are the highest kind of activity on it.

Lem   47:29
We.

Bryan Wolf   47:29
So get touched by volume or what?

Lem   47:32
We would just put a filter there and then let's see more like if the post has like 50 more 50 or more likes. So it would only put that one.
So there are certain criterias that.

Bryan Wolf   47:45
Yeah, I'd be looking for more ones that had like, you know, 1002 thousand likes. There's some of this stuff that, yeah, right.

Lem   47:50
Yeah, something like that. Oh, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   47:52
So a much higher number, but if you're saying there's a parameter we can use, that's what I'm looking for.

Lem   47:53
Oh yeah, if, if, if Twitter.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
Yeah, there's a parameter there.
And then yeah, it it would.
We would put that on.
Yeah. Actually that's yeah.
Using appify we could do that one, but basically yeah it it would scrape the social media for our criteria and then we would just take that one and then put it feed the data to like ChatGPT and yeah to create this particular.
Section.

Bryan Wolf   48:28
So I think if we again similar to the spreadsheet we already have, we feed in and say, OK.

Lem   48:28
Uh.
The only.

Bryan Wolf   48:34
Here's the here's the viral topic, right?
And we would have the link to it or whatever, and then we could pick and choose which ones we wanted to include.
Similar kind of way we're doing with the articles.

Lem   48:45
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
Yeah, we could.
Yeah, we could do another like spreadsheet for this particular section that we could choose from.
That's right.
The only thing here is for this like screenshot, so I'm not sure how how.

Bryan Wolf   49:03
Right.

Lem   49:04
Yeah, how they're doing this particular screenshot so.

Bryan Wolf   49:06
I'm not so worried about that.
I'm. I'm not so worried about that.

Lem   49:09
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   49:09
I mean that would be nice and nice to have, but I can put any kind of visual up there as long as I have the bottom part.

Lem   49:12
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   49:16
I mean, that's kind of cool to have a screenshot of someone's LinkedIn post, but we could also maybe add that one manually or something, right?

Lem   49:19
Uh.
Yep. Yeah, it is, right.
Could also like we could.
Yeah, we could actually add that manually to the spreadsheet and then like we would have there like a website like.
Image URL or something that chat like? Yeah, it would pick it up and then feed it to the that particular section.
Yeah, basically that would be one.

Bryan Wolf   49:45
So I I would like it if you start moving forward on that, figuring that out how we'd go about that.

Lem   49:49
For yeah.

Bryan Wolf   49:52
And then incorporating it into the newsletter for sure.

Lem   49:56
Yeah, yeah, I could.
Yeah. Do I have a?
Yeah, that particular system on mine using the using appify data scraping.
So it's on like LinkedIn, right?

Bryan Wolf   50:07
OK so.

Lem   50:09
LinkedIn, Reddit and LinkedIn. Reddit.

Bryan Wolf   50:13
LinkedIn, rather than an X. Yeah, I think that's.

Lem   50:16
Yeah, and.
X.

Bryan Wolf   50:21
I mean, maybe later on we add something, but for right now, I think that's enough variety that we can get. We can get content we want.

Lem   50:29
Yeah.
So I'm not sure is this like.
Tiktok. Yeah. Tikto shared the. Oh, yeah. So it's coming from different social media.
OK, social media platforms.

Bryan Wolf   50:46
Oh, what about YouTube?
I mean, that might be a different, right?
'Cause that's it's not really social media.
Yeah, but there might be a section that we would do on YouTube.
Like, analyze the whole video and take the transcript and then you know, well, I'm interested in.

Lem   51:01
Yeah, but that's true.

Bryan Wolf   51:01
I'm interested in considering that also, but.

Lem   51:06
Actually, yeah.
Apify also have like scraping for.
YouTube and then it already has the.
It already has the I think the transcription.

Bryan Wolf   51:24
OK.

Lem   51:25
But yeah, I think it's possible also.

Bryan Wolf   51:29
Alright, so you know this week we we only worked on one flow, but I kind of look at that like the one from last week, right?
The flow was a heavier flow. We're going into more detail, so I'm fine that we only did one flow right as long as we're we're building in these complexities and at the end of the day, the effort that we're putting in or the you know the the kind.
Of equivalency of work of saying 2 flows well in my view this is this is achieving that right and this to me right now.

Lem   51:57
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   51:59
I'm really focused on bringing this to fruition to get this finalized.
I want to get this in production. The newsletter yeah.
I want to get in production and I don't want it just to be the articles. I want it to be this other stuff too.
And so I really want to focus over the next couple days and I know it's the weekend, but I mean over the coming, the beginning days of next week, it really needs to be the first thing is like banging that out.
How can we?
How can we get that social media content and put build some kind of structure so it would be like that again? I'm looking at superhuman and wanting to do something equivalent.
I'm thinking I'm also going to have a prompt of the week or a prompt of the you know, the.
The whether we do it bi weekly or whatever, because I like that they're putting in some pretty cool prompts.

Lem   52:40
OK.

Bryan Wolf   52:42
And I think what we do is we go figure out the prompts. We want to have.
We can already stage them in the spreadsheet as well and just say hey, here's the one. I'm gonna include this week cuz they don't even write commentary there. I mean, I don't know if this one had it in, but maybe go look, Scroll down. I don't think it.
Does OK.
But there was when you see him.
And again, this is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna feed a whole bunch into ChatGPT and have it. Umm.
Analyze them and see what's kind of consistent in that, because I think it's just a great delivery mechanism to get a lot of good content. When I clicked in and they got like links to all these AI tools that are just awesome stuff, right?
It's really informative, so I want this to be that informative, but geared towards our audience.

Lem   53:27
Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   53:28
All right. So can you work on that, Lynn and Lemme, I'll free up the I'll.

Lem   53:31
Yeah, I know.

Bryan Wolf   53:32
I'll make the payment. Right. I'll. I'll release the milestone.

Lem   53:36
OK.
That's good. Yeah, I'll.

Bryan Wolf   53:37
Alright. And we'll go into next week's same expectation, right, same structure, OK.

Lem   53:41
I'll yeah, I'll work on it.
Yeah, starting on next week and then, yeah, basically that would be a data scraping.
Flow and then yeah, I it would also be like different steps.
So we would add that flows on here on the newsletter.
So yeah, it it would add some complexities there. But yeah, it would be multiple flows also.

Bryan Wolf   54:00
Yeah.
Yeah. So, but it would be.
I see it like being another flow, like the manual input and the inode reader, but specifically for this it's gonna go into a, you know, into a similar central place where we can pick and choose and say these are the ones that are gonna go in this news.

Lem   54:09
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   54:19
And ultimately, we're sending the package, but we're we're having a staging ground where we get all the component pieces and say, Yep, this is what I wanna include.
And then we bring it together.

Lem   54:28
Yeah, that's right. Yep. So yeah.

Bryan Wolf   54:30
Alright, so if you can work on that, awesome. I appreciate it, Len.
