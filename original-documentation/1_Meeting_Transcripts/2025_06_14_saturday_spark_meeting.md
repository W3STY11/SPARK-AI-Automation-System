Peter Wolf   7:23
Looks like his connection must be bad.

Bryan Wolf   7:40
Hmm.

Lem   7:41
Hello.
Can you guys hear me now?

Bryan Wolf   7:43

Peter Wolf   7:45
We can hear you, Lem.
Can you hear us?

Lem   7:51
Hello.

Nicholas Westburg   7:56
These connections bad.

Peter Wolf   8:18
Turn off my camera.
Make sure it's minimizing the amount that's pushing through.

Nicholas Westburg   8:30
All right, Brian, time for you to get to take over.

Bryan Wolf   8:34
Yeah, right.

Lem   8:35
Yeah.
Hello.

Bryan Wolf   8:42
LAN, can you hear us?

Lem   8:42
Yeah.
Yeah, I can hear.

Bryan Wolf   8:45
Alright, great.

Lem   8:46
I I put it on my laptop now.

Bryan Wolf   8:47
Awesome.

Lem   8:48
OK, awesome. It sounds like we got.

Peter Wolf   8:49
It sounds like we got.
Yeah, kind of repeat.

Lem   8:52
Yeah. We on my speaker is acting up.
I'm. I'm in my head to head headset.
Yeah. OK, I'll.
Try to share my screen.
So can you guys see this now? Yep.

Peter Wolf   9:10
Yep.

Lem   9:17
OK.
Yeah. So this is the like simple scraping flow I built so actually.
I've added three.
Three, like sections now as.

Peter Wolf   9:32
OK.

Lem   9:34
Good.

Bryan Wolf   9:38
OK.

Lem   9:39
OK.
Yeah. So this one.
So the I've added three sections which is the.
AI automation tools and then also social media content and also.
For the.
He ate 2 social media content and intro.
So it added also the intro.
So now.
Yeah, that one. And then I've added.
For the for the.
Like the social media one.
So we are actually scraping it through appify.
So this is this appify is like a market marketplace for data scraping platform so.
It's for the first route.
It's actually scraping LinkedIn posts and then the second route is scraping Reddit post and then I added a filter here for the LinkedIn one which is more than 1500 likes. So.
And this is actually coming from like the.
Famous LinkedIn profile so we can add more profiles here if you want.
I just research on like top level who are the main main like main.

Peter Wolf   11:15
Posters.

Lem   11:16
Posters. Yeah, main post main. Like most of the viral ones that post on AI automation. And then for the Reddit. So I I'm researching this on the R automation site.

Peter Wolf   11:19
Influencers or whatever, yeah.

Lem   11:30
So this one so this are like Reddit posts.
That are mostly involving AI and automation. And then yeah. Then I've added a filter there. Then I've feed it to ChatGPT to just choose the top three.
So ChatGPT will choose the top three and then also create the like the overview and like the citations and title citation links.
And then it will add to the the new Google sheet.
So the new Google sheet will be this one.
So we have here already the title, so because I.
On the.
The title is just like this is not.

Peter Wolf   12:14
Whatever the the string title is.

Lem   12:15
Whatever the the string title is, yeah, so the title is just very short, like a two to three word title and then this is the link that will be added on the title.

Peter Wolf   12:17
For the conversation.

Lem   12:27
So the title would be clickable and then this is like the.
Overview of that particular post. So I knew MIT salary was at heavier lines on a A2 such as something like that.
So now we can also add here. So like we can check what are the like the posts that we want to add on our newsletter and then if we check here we would add that one.
So now I will remove this yes trigger here and then.
We the trigger will be here on the last part like social media post so that it will be like.

Peter Wolf   13:01
So you go through each tab, figure out what you want to include.

Lem   13:02
But you go through each tab, figure out what you want to include.

Peter Wolf   13:06
That feedback is bad.

Lem   13:06
Feedback.

Peter Wolf   13:08
But the the trigger would be at the very end when you've now selected the social media.

Lem   13:09
But the trigger would be at the very end when you've now selected the social media.

Peter Wolf   13:13
But it would already take the settings from the filtered articles as well.

Lem   13:13
But it would already take the settings from the filtered articles as well.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah. So this would be already filtered by ChatGPT and then he it already.
Push out like a overview for that particular post that when you say the trigger yes here.

Peter Wolf   13:28
But when you say the trigger, yes, here it's gonna grab whatever ones are highlighted in this tab.

Lem   13:33
Gonna grab whatever ones are highlighted in this tab.
Yes, that's right. And also here.

Peter Wolf   13:37
Plus the ones that are highlighted in the other tab, yeah.

Lem   13:39
Yep, that's right.
So this one I will delete this trigger content but I will not do it for now because we would need to map this again the other ones and. But I already set the web hook here and it's already connected to the web book here for because I test.

Peter Wolf   13:52
OK.

Lem   13:54
It awhile ago, so it's already grabbing the articles here and also it's grabbing the social media content here.
And then Yep, and for the the AI tools I actually incorporated it here on the.
Here on the. Yeah, on this particular automation.
So I I didn't add it on the scraping because I've tested this GPT 40 search and it's actually working well and it's actually grabbing like some EA tools and.
The Altos with the overview and also the citation link.
So it's good.
So I've I've feed it already to the to this particular section.
So yeah, we won't be needing to.

Peter Wolf   14:43
OK.

Lem   14:47
Like add it to the spreadsheet if that makes sense so.

Peter Wolf   14:52
Well, we'll have to see when we have that it to the spreadsheet because it would.

Lem   14:53
Because we have to see when we have that anticipation, because it would, we don't know how many it's gonna get back.

Peter Wolf   14:56
We don't know how many it's gonna get back.
We don't know if it's already gotten those items from previous list.

Lem   14:59
We don't know if it's already gotten those items from previous list.
Yeah, actually we can actually add it here on the this I mean on the other one.
This one so I can add it here and then put a new spreadsheet there so.

Peter Wolf   15:16
I think we should do that.

Lem   15:17
I think we should do that. Yeah. So we would have here another one that like AI tools.
AI tools and updates so that we could also choose the.
Yeah, the particular AI tools also.
So yeah this.
Actually.
Yeah, better if that one.
So I I I'll add it I think.
Yeah, it's better to like add it one by one and then we could just choose.
Yeah, we could just choose the particular.
AI tools or updates to add on the newest.
So yeah, yeah. Same as we got methodology for the others, that makes sense.

Peter Wolf   15:54
Yep, same as we got this methodology for the others. That makes sense.

Lem   16:00
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
So yeah, I think, yeah, it would be.
I think you could put it here on the so this would just be the like AI.
Tools and updates.
Then I'll just remove this particular column.
So all of the this one will be the trigger will be the last one, the social media post. Yeah. And then there's one.

Peter Wolf   16:35
Yeah. Good.
There's one.
There's one more thing I want to include. Is there anyway we can do anything about?

Lem   16:39
There's one more thing I want to include.
Is there anyway we can do anything about them?

Peter Wolf   16:45
The feedback.

Lem   16:45
Feedback.
Pardon.

Peter Wolf   16:50
Yeah, every time I speak, it just comes back to me.

Bryan Wolf   16:51
You've got a little echo in your mic, Glenn.

Lem   16:51
Yeah, every time.
I'm just coming back, yes.

Peter Wolf   16:53
Yes, it's reading through your phone and your laptop or something.

Lem   16:55
It's reading through your phone and your laptop or something where it's hearing it and then play it back to me.

Peter Wolf   16:58
Where it's hearing it and then play it back to me. So we hear every time we speak.

Lem   17:02
So we hear every time we speak.

Peter Wolf   17:04
Two seconds behind that, we hear the exact same words repeated back and gets kind of hard to think.

Lem   17:05
Two seconds behind that, we hear the exact same words repeated back and gets kind of hard to think.

Peter Wolf   17:15
So the there's another component I wanna put in here.

Lem   17:16
So the there's another component I want to put in here.

Peter Wolf   17:21
Jeez, I'm gonna turn off my sound for a minute here.

Lem   17:21
Is I'm gonna turn off my sound.

Peter Wolf   17:25
There's another component I want to put in here that is a prompt of the week or prompt of the day, and I was trying to think about this because in the finance treasury space, the issue is companies don't want to put their proprietary information into a non protect.
Tool because the information goes out to the.
You know, to some other storage location where it could be accessible and it could be proprietary information.
And it's sensitive.
So either companies or people that work in finance or Treasury Department, they'll either have to use internal.
Llm's or Gpt's that are behind their firewall.
So if they got copilot or if they have custom LLM or something like that.
Otherwise, if they use external, they can't put proprietary data in there.
So I was trying to think about what can I put as prompts that would be worthwhile now.
You could certainly say in the prompting.
Section. These prompts are for only for use with your internal gpts, right?
Pre trained models so that you don't send the data outside, but I thought that would be kind of limiting cause a lot of companies don't have that yet and so putting those kinds of prompts would not be real helpful.
So I started thinking about what other kinds of prompts could be used that would be not sensitive, but that would be viewed as valuable.

Lem   18:47
What other kinds of prompts?
Would be not sensitive, but that would be viewed as valuable.

Peter Wolf   18:56
And I went and kind of I was driving down to the shore, was talking with.

Lem   18:56
And I went and kind of I was driving down to the shore, was talking with.

Peter Wolf   19:02
I don't know Claude or one of them.

Lem   19:03
I don't know Claude or one of them.

Peter Wolf   19:03
No, I guess it was either rocker.

Lem   19:04
No, I guess it was either rocker.

Peter Wolf   19:07
ChatGPT and I came up with some props were pretty decent like going to the to external sites to analyze foreign currency exchange rate changes over the past period between certain pairs of currencies, and what's been the change and what were the drivers.

Lem   19:07
Chest EBT and I came up with some props, were pretty decent, like going to the to external sites to analyze.
Foreign currency exchange rate changes over the past period between certain pairs of currencies and what's been the change and what were the drivers?

Peter Wolf   19:26
It's kind of either you know, country specific.

Lem   19:27
Kind of.
Either country specific.

Peter Wolf   19:31
Financials or economic issues or other events.

Lem   19:31
Financials or economic issues or other events.

Peter Wolf   19:34
So I was thinking, OK, I could come up with some prompts like that, figuring there's only one per per article or per newsletter.

Lem   19:35
So I was thinking, OK, I could come up with some prompts like that, figuring there's only one per per article or per news.

Peter Wolf   19:43
I mean, if you came up with 10, obviously and you're doing once a week, you're good for the next 2 1/2 months. If you're doing even 2A week, you're still you're good for a month.
So it's not like this is an overwhelming demand from a coming up with them, but I wanna. I thought that was a pretty cool.

Lem   19:52
Like this is an overwhelming demand from a coming up with them.
But I wanna. I thought that was a pretty cool part of the of what they deliver in the superhuman everyday is one prompt and they're always very comprehensive prompts.

Peter Wolf   19:57
Part of the of what they deliver in the superhuman everyday is one prompt.
And they're always very comprehensive prompts.
It's not like A1 sentence prompt, but a very comprehensive prompt that that for you to utilize. And I thought that was pretty interesting.

Lem   20:13
Interesting.

Peter Wolf   20:15
So I think I want to do that, but I'm not sure how we structure that one.

Lem   20:15
So I think I want to do that.

Peter Wolf   20:18
It's probably a prompt that we.

Lem   20:20
Probably a Trump that.

Peter Wolf   20:22
Again, maybe we put them in a spreadsheet and or they have we have a link to the prompts in the spreadsheet and we select them the same way we're doing here.
But this isn't something where we go out and search the Internet for it. I think we would develop these and then have a cachet of them that we can incorporate into the newsletter.
That makes sense.

Lem   20:44
Yeah, that makes sense, I think.
Yeah, I think we could also use like.
AI models on like creating the prompt and then we would like figure. That's what I'm doing.

Peter Wolf   20:52
No, that's what I'm doing.
That's what I'm saying.

Lem   20:54
That's what I'm saying.

Peter Wolf   20:54
I'm using AI models to make the prompts, but then I'm saying we're not gonna go out and search the Internet for them.

Lem   20:55
I'm using AI models to make the prompts, but then I'm saying we're not gonna go out and search the Internet for them.

Peter Wolf   21:01
We'll define what those prompts are and store them, and then one per newsletter. We pull one to include.

Lem   21:02
We'll define what those prompts are, OK and store them, and then one per per newsletter. We pool one to include.
Yeah, we'll include that.
Like we will choose, right?
Also the same as the other one.
What the what prompt will be included on the newsletter?

Peter Wolf   21:22
Yeah, right.
So we have a list of them and we'll say, OK, I already got the next 10 and I just pick which ones gonna go this week.

Lem   21:23
Yeah, right.
So we have a list of.

Peter Wolf   21:30
Then we show it's already processed, so we don't grab it the next week and then we just get the next one. We got a history of all of our prompts and we have them, you know, ready to go for the next newsletter. You just select the next button.

Lem   21:43
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Yep, we could also add it on the.
OK.

Peter Wolf   21:53
Still looks like we're we're we're getting along here.

Lem   21:54
So it looks like we're.

Peter Wolf   21:57
Can you show what the output looks like now or or is it not compiled yet?

Lem   22:01
Is it not?
Oh yeah that I tested the output, but for the like the formatting.
Chat gpti would need to like batch it.

Peter Wolf   22:12
Action.

Peter Wolf   22:14
Yeah, I think this is where we have to look at it, because if you're using the same kind of structure for some of them, it's not gonna be appropriate, right.

Lem   22:14
Twice. Yeah, I think this is where we have to look at it, because if you're using the same kind of structure for some of them, it's not gonna be appropriate, right.

Peter Wolf   22:22
If we look at the superhuman and even that it, it's as I'm looking back, it's kind of a little different.

Lem   22:22
Yeah. And also superhuman.
And even that it it's as I'm looking back. It's kinda look different.

Peter Wolf   22:28
It's the first section has three blurbs.

Lem   22:28
It's the first section that says 3 globs.

Peter Wolf   22:32
The title. You know the number 123 for that day. That's the articles.

Lem   22:33
They're tight, you know, they're number 123 for that day.
That's the articles, but we can do them as separate sections I guess.

Peter Wolf   22:38
But we could do them as separate sections I guess.
But then when it gets down to the.

Lem   22:41
But then when it gets down to the.

Peter Wolf   22:45
Either the tools.

Lem   22:45
Either the tools that's not gonna be.

Peter Wolf   22:47
That's not gonna behold blurb.
It's gonna be something much shorter, right? When it gets to the when it gets to. Also the social media, that's also gonna be much shorter.
It's not gonna be a huge long write up.
At least I don't.
I don't think right now when I look at what they did, they do a superhuman.

Lem   23:02
Right now, when I look at what they do, they do it superhuman.

Peter Wolf   23:05
They make that much shorter, enough of a tagline to get you interested that you click on and you go to it.

Lem   23:07
Enough of a.

Peter Wolf   23:11
Decide if you wanna read it or not.
But not a full 50 words.
For each of those, right?

Lem   23:17
Right. Yeah, yeah, that's right.
And then we will compile it to just one table.
So it's all of the like, social media content is on one section, subsection one, Section 2 bullets.

Peter Wolf   23:26
Right. One section with few bullets, yeah.

Lem   23:29
Yep, yeah, and the bullet points. OK, so that I think we need to work.

Peter Wolf   23:31
OK.
So that's what I think we need to work on is to clean up that structural aspect to figure out exactly what we need to do with it.
So if we can, if we can start to look at what is the output we're getting right now and then figure out how we want to morph that.
To to fit with this model. Think that's where we're at, right?
We're getting to the point now where we need to be really detailed in in what we're expecting the outputs to look like and to pull this all together.

Lem   24:01
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
So I'll go.
I also tried to output it like to try the like the formatting on ChatGPT but.
Unfortunately it it outputs like a uncomplete code with because there's like a limit for the output results. So I think OK I've added maybe I think I added because 2400 tokens only.

Peter Wolf   24:21
OK.

Peter Wolf   24:25
That's what he said.

Lem   24:29
So I think that's the thing. But So what did you do to change the format?

Peter Wolf   24:32
So what did you do to to change the format now?

Lem   24:35
Now I I've also changed the prompt.
So the prompt for the ChatGPT I've actually updated and add the sections for the for the like the new new sections, but.
A while ago, I think it it outputted.
Uncomplete one because.
I've added the result as because the tokens are.
Let me just check too many for one conversation or output.

Peter Wolf   25:09
Too many for one conversation or output.

Lem   25:12
Yeah. So the oh, I added the Max completion tokens is 2048. So that's why I think that This is why.
It outputed uncomplete but basically I can.
Try it to.
If it test it out again right now, if we're ready ultimately correctly.

Peter Wolf   25:37
Well, I'm hoping next call we have.

Lem   25:38
We're moving this call.

Peter Wolf   25:39
We don't have this audio issue.

Lem   25:39
We have.
We don't have this audio issue. This is really.

Peter Wolf   25:40
This is really.
Taxi my brain.

Lem   25:44
Back to my brain.

Peter Wolf   25:47
OK so.

Lem   25:47
OK so.

Peter Wolf   25:50
Yeah, we need to push forward this.
We need to really start to get into the details, get this to the point where we get, we're getting structured output.
We want.
I think we need to look at and I think we need to look at what the selection criteria are as well because for mine, again you guys might have stuff that's going to be materially different. If you want to do and play around with this stuff, but for.

Peter Wolf   26:13
Check.

Peter Wolf   26:14
What I'm looking for here I'm thinking.
There's one that's going to be for my team specifically and then I want to.
Understand where those controls and parameters are so that we can change the inputs like right now.
This again, where I think maybe maybe changing the input so that they're not directly in make, but they're in a document that you feed into make might be better when we say what are the selection criteria for the LinkedIn articles or?
For the social media, what is it that we?

Peter Wolf   26:48
Wow. Something like.

Peter Wolf   26:50
Specifically one.

Peter Wolf   26:52
That.

Peter Wolf   26:53
And right now you're doing that in the make selection. You're writing that into the into the individual, you know step. I think this is where having a document that would contain that information or a spreadsheet or something would be easier to manage. That way you don't have to.
Go into make every time to do it.
You just structure this thing and you adjust the Word document a little easier, I think.
To identify OK, where's the? Where are the component pieces we need to change?
Well, here's.
The word documents that go along with this process flow.
Here's where you identify what you want for your selection criteria for the news feed, and maybe this is impossible.
The news feed one you have to go identify and set up the account and set up the particular buckets you want to pull and you have to put all the definition and maybe that's the case.

Bryan Wolf   27:41
Say you saying a word, doc.

Peter Wolf   27:42
That might be the case for these others too.

Bryan Wolf   27:44
Are you saying a Word document for the prompts, or are you saying a Word document for the entire?

Peter Wolf   27:50
So yeah, what? I'm what I'm trying to do is design a solution that doesn't require.

Peter Wolf   27:53
The job.

Peter Wolf   27:59
A user to go in to make to change it each time.

Bryan Wolf   28:02
And start.

Peter Wolf   28:03
Like, is there some way to make this more like?
Here's the package.
Make stays the same and we hand it over to another team that has the exact same process flow, but they attach profile documents and prompt documents that are geared towards their profile, their background, their.

Bryan Wolf   28:18
Go.

Peter Wolf   28:20
Objective their target market like they may be focused on accounts payable, may be focused on cash application for accounts receivable and instead of having to go into the individual make components to change them and say hey, I want to focus on this piece.

Peter Wolf   28:31
So.
Just be sure you get out.
Get well.

Peter Wolf   28:35
That's why we have right now.
It's updating and loading a persona.

Peter Wolf   28:38
Soon.

Nicholas Westburg   28:39
Hey guys I got a jet.
Thank you.

Peter Wolf   28:41
Yep. See you, nick. That we're uploading a persona, and the persona is defining a lot of that stuff.
But some of this we're defining.
Directly in make and what what I need to understand is at each of those steps which ones are specific to this and it's really up the search point up further, right?
So that's the the newsletter input.

Lem   29:02
I see.

Peter Wolf   29:06
The the, the the social media selection, the tool selection right now, they are defined inside of make and I wanna know can we define them outside of make?
In a document that gets referenced, instead of changing the settings inside the individual component pieces inmake.

Bryan Wolf   29:29
Burb.

Lem   29:31
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   29:31
Len, what do you think about that?

Lem   29:32
And then what do you think about that? Yeah, yeah, we we can actually do that.

Peter Wolf   29:34
Is that right?

Lem   29:37
We will just like like add.
Like a document before before the, let's say ChatGPT for the prompt and also like.
Before.
Before the, let's say for the appify before the before the app, if we would need to, yeah, like a dynamic document that we could change for the parameter.

Peter Wolf   30:00
Yeah. So for the prompt one we already have, I think, right, we're we're submitting the the Persona documentation.

Lem   30:01
So yeah.
So for the prompt, what we already have, I think, right, we're we're submitting the Persona documentation.

Peter Wolf   30:04
Thank you.

Peter Wolf   30:10
But what about what about on this scraper?

Lem   30:14
Creeper Oh yeah, the parameters for the scraping is that it.

Peter Wolf   30:15
The parameters for the scraping is that it.
Is that something we could do as a document input instead of the make input?

Peter Wolf   30:17
Yeah.

Lem   30:18
Is that something we can do as a document input instead of the make input?
Yeah, we could because there's only like a query for the.
So it's actually changeable.
Let's say I've added the query query there for AI and automation, so it could be also for a different topic, let's say.
Finance, or let's say accounting, do we know what the topics are?

Peter Wolf   30:41
Do we know what the topics are?
Do they have a predefined list or do you just freeform it?

Peter Wolf   30:43
It's.

Lem   30:43
Do they have a three to five list?
Or do you just freeform it?

Peter Wolf   30:47
Yeah.

Lem   30:49
For the Reddit one, you would choose like a subreddit for that one.
So maybe so we have to go find the subreddit center of interest.

Peter Wolf   30:53
So we have to go find the subreddit center of interest to us.

Lem   30:57
Yep, Yep, that's right.
Yeah, like a famous subreddit regarding, let's say, got it, yeah.

Peter Wolf   30:58
OK.
Got it.
OK.
So we need to figure that out then.

Lem   31:03
And so we need to figure that out then.

Peter Wolf   31:05
Couldn't that be like a spreadsheet or Google sheet input?

Lem   31:06
Yeah. Couldn't that be like a spreadsheet or Google sheet input?

Peter Wolf   31:07
I'm good.

Peter Wolf   31:09
Here's here's the list of reddits and subreddits we're interested in.

Lem   31:10
Here's here's the list of reddits and subreddits we're interested in.
Oh, so like.
Yeah, it could actually be, I think, but we would need to like trigger again there because it will pull out.

Peter Wolf   31:30
Is the most energy.

Lem   31:31
Yeah, yeah, because actually do that once or.

Peter Wolf   31:36
Hey, can I ask you switched over to what?

Lem   31:36
You switched over to what your phone or something.

Peter Wolf   31:36
They call themselves. I do, and they are smarts. And I do that.

Peter Wolf   31:39
Your phone or something.
This is just killing me. Here is so much feedback it's impossible to think.

Lem   31:40
This is just killing me.
Here it's so.

Peter Wolf   31:44
Will touch you every day, every two frauds, every day.

Peter Wolf   31:46
Can we try and connect back to what the original model was?
I know it wasn't working for you, but this is just not manageable.

Peter Wolf   31:49
It's not ******* stats, but I.

Peter Wolf   31:54
I don't know if you're getting on your side, but we're getting just tremendous feedback everywhere we say is coming back to us along with like echoing and.

Peter Wolf   31:59
Actually.

Lem   32:03
Oh yeah, I think this because I'm on my laptop.
I'll just reconnect.
I'll try to close this browser and reconnect quickly.

Peter Wolf   32:13
Thanks. Appreciate it.

Lem   32:14
OK. Thanks.

Bryan Wolf   32:20
It was bad, huh?

Peter Wolf   32:22
Yeah, they just can't even think.

Bryan Wolf   32:25
Yeah, so the subreddit stuff. That's good that Nick can just slaughter that with, you know, a bunch of options for us to follow.

Peter Wolf   32:26
So.

Peter Wolf   32:35
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'd like to do is come up with a spreadsheet.
That lists a whole bunch that we could select which ones we wanted.
You know, and put them into the spreadsheet.
Now I know I'm. I'm I'm over engineering this.
I mean, really what I should do is is go with the, populating them in manually right now and work on the structure and the format instead of all this other stuff.
They're all nice to have.
Maybe that's really what we should do, right?
Not umm.
Not not. Focus on.
Making this more robust, but really defining exactly what we want in the make right now and then later on we can expand with set of tools that make it more user friendly.

Lem   33:19
Hello. Hello.

Peter Wolf   33:20
Hey.
Can you hear us Lim?

Lem   33:23
Can you guys hear me?

Peter Wolf   33:24
We can hear you.

Lem   33:24
Yeah, I can hear you.

Peter Wolf   33:25
Can you hear us?

Bryan Wolf   33:26
Oh great.

Lem   33:26
Yeah, yeah, I think this is already working, yeah.

Peter Wolf   33:27
Oh, much better lemons.
That was really bad, OK.

Lem   33:32
Yeah. OK.

Peter Wolf   33:32
So look, I'm. I'm sitting here talking to Brian and I'm thinking, you know what?
These tools I'm talking about are the ways of advancing the the flow and making it more user friendly with documents instead of with the make entries.

Lem   33:44
OK.

Peter Wolf   33:47
I want to do that, but as I'm thinking about it, that's not the best use of time right now.
Right now we should use the make entry as it is, but we need to. I need to know exactly where those points are and what the.

Lem   33:53
OK.

Peter Wolf   34:01
What the entries are so we can figure out how we can add more definition again?
For me, for this first newsletter, everything needs to be focused on financed Treasury, corporate, treasury.
Treasury technology and AI, right?
Not just AI, can't be generic.

Lem   34:19
OK.

Peter Wolf   34:19
It's got to really have the Treasury, corporate, treasury and finance spin on it.
So if that needs to be in the direct entries on the prompts, then I need to understand what selection criteria we have, like we were talking about before you switched over. Are these predefined?

Lem   34:36
OK.

Peter Wolf   34:36
Categories or these just terminologies we're putting in like with the AI tools.
I know you said with the reddits.
We need to go figure out what the reddits and subreddits are that are relevant to us, right?
So that one. OK, we'll come up with a list.

Lem   34:49
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   34:50
But what about the tools one what you said you were doing that with a regular 4.040 search or something.

Lem   34:51
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   34:52
Perfect.

Peter Wolf   34:54
Oh.

Lem   34:57
Yeah, that's right.
So for that one, yeah, we would need to edit the prompt.
So the prompt actually for that one, I've just let me just.

Peter Wolf   35:06
Please.

Lem   35:10
A few contexts on that one only so.
It uh.
This one. So for the contacts I've just added.
Yeah, this one.
So latest AI automation tools.
So we could just this is the like the the query for this particular prompt.
So yeah, we could.

Peter Wolf   35:39
So we just changed that.
That's that's not a predefined category, that's just terminology.

Lem   35:42
Yep.

Peter Wolf   35:45
You came up with or is that? Yeah. OK.

Lem   35:45
Yeah, just a terminology.
So Yep, that's right, because this is just a prompting.
So but for the, let's say, the news article, we would need to go back to our inner reader and like, change our. But this one is already like finance, all finance and economics. So it's actually.

Peter Wolf   35:55
Yeah.

Lem   36:04
Yeah, feeding the, but we actually have filter also here, but it needs like the pro plan like if it has like AI or something.
So for the news article, for again for the API.
It's actually here on the like query.
So as I've said, for the LinkedIn one, we would just change the like the.
Accounts here for the.

Peter Wolf   36:36
So again, this is just prominent accounts that are covering the topic that were there's lots of activity.

Lem   36:40
Yep, that's right and I.
Yeah, that's right.
So I am the one who put them here and I just searched the like the top Leo and also for the Reddit one is on. This is a subreddit.

Peter Wolf   36:47
Right.

Lem   36:54
So the subreddit is here, so it's actually editable.
We can like put this as dynamic.

Peter Wolf   37:00
Right. So so like I was saying later on, maybe we would have some kind of variable input to this, but let's just stick with this.

Lem   37:08
Yep.

Peter Wolf   37:08
We'll go do the searches for the Redis and sub reddits and whatever else and then put them directly into make and will worry about whether we can make this more robust later, right?

Lem   37:13
OK.

Peter Wolf   37:19
So it's it's linked insights, it's Reddit sites, and on the news feed we already have.

Lem   37:20
Yep.

Peter Wolf   37:21
Set up.

Lem   37:24
Yep.

Peter Wolf   37:27
The we have to refine it, but we have already.

Lem   37:28
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   37:29
Election criteria.
There to counts what news accounts and topics, and then we have the the search for AI tools, which is just some selection criteria.

Lem   37:32
Yeah.
Yeah, this one.

Peter Wolf   37:44
Again, generic entry prompt selection criteria.

Lem   37:45
Yep.
Yep, that's right. So.

Peter Wolf   37:48
And what's the output from that?
Like you don't have a a number of tools or what's what's coming out of that actually?

Lem   37:56
The output is something like this.
So AI tools name. Let's say Apple shortcuts up upgrade and then Apple.

Peter Wolf   38:01
No, but I'm saying when you ran this, what did you get?
How many 'cause you didn't? I didn't see a number of tools you didn't say. Give me two or five or 10. Or maybe you did, but I didn't see it.

Lem   38:09
I.
Five. Yeah, I've added a 5 here, so yeah, so that's why it will output also five.

Peter Wolf   38:12
OK.
See, I think this was definitely when we have to have a spreadsheet because with that it would seem to me, you know, the tools may not change very often. So it could pull the same ones over and over again.

Lem   38:16
So we could change this.
Yeah, it's.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah. So I will just add here another step for.
Extracting this one because this particular ChatGPT can format the the output, so I will add here another.
ChatGPT.
Basically, to extract that one and then add add that, add it to the. I mean no this should be.
I will remove this one and.
I will add it on the scraping.
So it will be.

Peter Wolf   38:59
So it goes to a spreadsheet as well.

Lem   39:01
Yeah, it will first.
Yeah, when this trigger, let's say daily.
So we will add that one here and then it will search the Internet and then it will extract that the data and then add it to the spreadsheet to the different spreadsheet. It will be the AI tools, ANAIN tools, updates and then yeah, so.

Peter Wolf   39:19
Yep.

Lem   39:21
Now we could also choose it here on the this one on a itos update, so you could now just.

Peter Wolf   39:25
OK, good. I like that, yeah.

Lem   39:28
Yeah.
Yeah. So basically that would be the, yeah, the new flow and then for the last, this will be like the trigger after. So the like the flow would be filtered articles.
So check the filtered articles.

Peter Wolf   39:42
Yep.

Lem   39:42
Then AI tools.
Also check the Alaa tools for then social media post.
Check the social media post and then just trigger yes.
And then yeah, it will all it will all take the data from the filter articles A A tools and social media post.
So this one will be getting. This automation will be getting all the data from all of that sheet and then Yep it will create.
Now it will create this particular document.
So Doc, I actually tested a while ago the documents, so it looks like this.
This is not a formatted 1, so this one is we can edit.
So this one is the one that we could edit.
So the image source there and CIT citation links are of course not like pictured because this is just all on on plain text.

Peter Wolf   40:32
OK, but hold on.
This one's just this has got the articles or this one's got the other stuff in it too.

Lem   40:37
Yeah, this is also have the the AA tools. So these are the AA tools the bottom.
The five AA tools and then also.

Peter Wolf   40:45
OK.

Lem   40:47
The social media.
I think it didn't pull out the social media yet, so I think I haven't added it yet so.
Oh, it just pulled up a test.
Yeah, I think it's.
Yeah, it didn't pull up.
I think.
Just go back to the.
I can feel this one.
All right, 'cause, I had the test here a while ago, so I didn't feed the results, so that's why.
So yeah, I can actually run this again.
And then we could.
Get all of the complete.
So this is just like missing because I mapped here available for just testing, so I didn't map it yet to feed all the social media.
But this is this will be like the social media coming from the database this one.

Peter Wolf   41:54
And so can you go back again?

Lem   41:54
So I've added the four.

Peter Wolf   41:55
This is one of these I was talking with Brian.
I'm trying to understand is the structuring.
You're showing the structure or you're telling it in HTML how to do it or what?

Lem   42:01
Oh.

Peter Wolf   42:04
What's where is that structuring come from?

Lem   42:10
For the.

Peter Wolf   42:12
For each of the components, right?

Lem   42:13
Structuring.
Yeah, for let's say for the automation 1.
So it the sending and pushing data and getting data. Here are all on Jason.
So this is actually like a Jason format and then?
For the.
Yeah. For the Jason format. And then sometimes for example, the one like this one, so.
This one. Do you mean the like the TA text or something?

Peter Wolf   42:46
Yeah, but even the whole thing.
How did? Where did you put the header?
Where did you put the? You know, the the word with the colon in front of it?
Where where is all that structure coming from?

Lem   42:59
I the all the structure here are just a manually inputted on the Google Docs, so it's just like this.
And then for the like every every value of variable here is actually coming from this one, right?
The aggregated 1.
So for example, this variable is inputting the result. Here the intro and also the result here which is the three bullet points.
And then we are adding that here on the Google Doc.
Hear the introduction.
And then this one.
These are the subsection, so it will output the.
Something like this image source. This is the image source citation link and then subsection result and then.

Peter Wolf   43:42
OK. But that right there.
Take that right there.

Lem   43:45
Yep, here.

Peter Wolf   43:46
That's you saying you wanted to look like that or that's you just saying this is where the content's coming from.

Lem   43:52
Yeah, I'm yeah, I'm basically saying that it should look like this for every every data that is coming out from the database from Google Sheets.
So it will aggregate all of the data with this particular format.

Peter Wolf   44:09
That that format again is.

Lem   44:09
Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   44:10
That it's is the format in the green part or is the format the black part that you're showing that says image sources?

Lem   44:17
Uh.

Peter Wolf   44:18
Is it gonna say image source?

Lem   44:21
Yeah, I've just added this for the naming so that on the following modules ChatGPT will be able to have a context that this is the image source, but we could actually change this, let's say.

Peter Wolf   44:30
It's not gonna say image source though.
This is what I'm saying. I'm trying to find the exact actual.

Lem   44:36
OK.

Peter Wolf   44:37
Structure you're doing.

Lem   44:38
Yeah, this will feed also the the final output for this would be a long string of text which is like this so image source. This is the image source and then subsection it will be like this image source then subsection content.

Peter Wolf   44:53
But that's only to feed it into some into ChatGPT again, right?

Lem   44:53
So.

Peter Wolf   44:56
That's not again, it doesn't say image source when you get the final outputs, you're feeding it back in, then, then ChatGPT is structured in HTML format.

Lem   45:02
Yep. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, so I've added this first because the first one that I built was already on HTML, and then you said that you wanted to have the choice to edit.

Peter Wolf   45:13
Yeah.
Ryan.

Lem   45:16
Yeah, edit the document.
So that's why I've all of the structure here would be on plain text the same as this one.

Peter Wolf   45:17
Yeah, yeah.
There are structures so we can get into a document so we can review it.

Lem   45:26
Yep, Yep, they're right. That's right.

Peter Wolf   45:28
OK.

Lem   45:28
And then the the last part if is the the one that is actually formatting it to H HTML, which is this, yeah.

Peter Wolf   45:34
So then you're feeding it back and it's stripping out the words like the image or image source and all that kind of stuff, and it's just swapping the image source in there.

Lem   45:40
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah.
Yes, that's right.
Yeah, it's it's just swapping.

Peter Wolf   45:44
Now when you feed it in, this is what I'm trying to understand. When you feed it in, are you already saying? Here's what I want it to look like and giving it the HTML structure you are is that input or output there?

Lem   45:54
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is the input, so I'm actually instructing ChatGPT that it will output this particular format so that.
The output would be uniform because we could actually take this out, but it will.
Of course it will output different formatting even it's in HTML. Let's say there there are no borders like other, so it won't be a uniform output.

Peter Wolf   46:14
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   46:16
Hello.

Lem   46:20
So I've added the final output structure here below so that it will.
It will output this particular formatting, so there are just some variables here that I've instructed it to change.
Let's say yeah, this one like the today's insights A1 paragraph, but the formatting here is would be same as this as the like the prompt that I've they've I've put. So Yep.

Peter Wolf   46:38
Quick.

Lem   46:48
In this way also we can.
We can like edit the formatting as we want.
So we basically ChatGPT is just formatting the like the text, the plain text to HTML code and then we are the ones who are setting the HTML like the design and all.
It's just putting the the dynamic dynamic text here on the HTML code that makes sense, yeah.

Peter Wolf   47:13
OK.

Lem   47:16
So yeah.
Basically that would be. That's it.
And yeah, so.
For yeah, I think that's it.
Yes, I actually tested it and ran it again.
And this one was the. Yeah. So this one is.

Peter Wolf   47:40
This.

Lem   47:41
Out for output wrong.
So I think it's because I just copy pasted.
Yeah, I would need to like edit this more for the formatting because this is like a pretty long prompt.
Maybe ChatGPT is getting confused?
Or something.
Yeah, but.
Basically.

Peter Wolf   48:01
Can I see that again?
What you had is that output.
Did you delete it or close it?

Lem   48:07
Oh yeah.

Peter Wolf   48:07
The the word doc that you were shown.

Peter Wolf   48:08
S.

Lem   48:10
Umm.
Yeah, this one.

Peter Wolf   48:12
Yeah.

Lem   48:13
Yeah. So yeah, this should be here.
So the output is.
I think it's all on middle, so there's something wrong there.
So I would need to update the like the HTML code there.
So yeah, it should be something like this and then this should be here right?
Same as the superhuman AI.
Then.
Yeah, this one like the title should be here and then the overview of the particular tools.

Peter Wolf   48:38
Yeah. OK.

Lem   48:40
But this is like a a links to that particular tool.
So for example this one.

Peter Wolf   48:46
Yeah.

Lem   48:46
And Google Gemini 2.0 release.
Yeah. So something like that. And yeah, the social media was not here because I added the test.
It was a wrong wrong output, so I need to.

Peter Wolf   48:59
OK.

Lem   48:59
I will need to rerun it again. Yeah, but for the formatting here, like the design and all we could just. Yeah, change it later.
Yeah. The more I think more important thing is to output it correctly first by subsections.

Peter Wolf   49:13
Yep, Yep.

Lem   49:15
Then we could just, yeah, optimize the like the designs and all after afterward.
So yeah, but yeah, the the social media.

Peter Wolf   49:20
OK.
All right. So then that's obviously that's what I want to focus on is kind of cleaning this organization structure up, getting this refined, getting the social media posts in there structured clean the the I want to refine the selection criteria on the on the AI tools to see.

Lem   49:29
Yep.

Peter Wolf   49:40
If we can, and this is a tricky one, right again because.

Lem   49:41
Yep.

Peter Wolf   49:45
You know, a lot of companies like my own, they restrict which tools you can use.
On your PC, right?
And they have a list even though I have tools on mine that are not allowed. I've had them contact me and say that they can see that I'm using a tool that needs to be immediately removed.

Lem   49:52
Hmm. Yep.

Peter Wolf   50:01
And I'm not sure what where it showed up, but they were they they became aware of it quickly and told me to remove it. And we have a list of approved tools, right?

Lem   50:08
OK.

Peter Wolf   50:10
So it's kind of tricky to say what new tools.
Or tools people could utilize.
I'm just thinking, OK.
Here's here's tools that I don't know.
And this is where again the generic search might not give us exactly what we want.
That's why the selection criteria is so important.
Where we get to individually select them to figure out which ones are most appropriate.

Lem   50:27
Yep.

Peter Wolf   50:33
But this is also where you could.

Lem   50:33
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   50:36
You know, although there's new tools coming out all the time, there's probably a set of tools right now that you could prepare for the next, you know, five issues, 10 issues of the newsletter to already have figured that out, right?
Right. It's not like that necessarily has to be figured out on the day, although when you're making announcements like the latest release of Claude or latest release of catchy BT well that's timely. You want to definitely pull out that kind of information, right?

Lem   50:50
Yeah.
Yep. Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   51:04
Or highlight that information.

Lem   51:06
Yeah, yeah, because this is actually like updates from last week.
Added on the prompt so.

Peter Wolf   51:14
OK.

Lem   51:15
It's actually, yeah, from last week.
So the context I added date also for today and if we double check also on the let's say on the you can actually double check if it's yeah June 14, 2025.
So this is from last week.
So these are, I think just updates from like the biggest companies because it's like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Adobe and this is.

Peter Wolf   51:36
Thank you.
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe that's fine.
You know, maybe for our that's that's the way to go is right.
Those big.

Lem   51:49
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   51:49
Those big, most famous, most recognized names to give them visibility.

Lem   51:54
Yep.

Peter Wolf   51:54
That new releases are out, right? Copilot, Claude. Whatever.

Lem   51:59
Yeah, that's right. So.
But yeah, basically we could refine the prompts. The prompt for the search and yeah, actually chat, ChatGPT is, yeah.

Peter Wolf   52:08
Yeah, I would do that.
I'll also tighten up this format, right?
Tighten this format not to be so much landscape, so much space between them, right?
But you said that's where the title really didn't come up in the right place in the OR no.

Lem   52:17
Yeah.
Yeah, this should be, yeah.
Here so I was.

Peter Wolf   52:25
Yeah, right.

Lem   52:28
Actually like the one that.
For the but I think this is much longer than their. They only have like A1 sentence, right?
One sentence, I think.

Peter Wolf   52:39
Yeah, they did, yes.

Lem   52:42
Yeah. So this is like a yeah, it's it's pretty like once, yeah.

Peter Wolf   52:45
It doesn't mean we have to do exactly the same as them, right?
But I do kind of like a little bit of like the check Marks and stuff like that.
That's making a little visually, even though that's very typical AI, it's fine.

Lem   52:54
Yeah, they the.

Peter Wolf   52:58
We're we're this is an AI newsletter, right?
It's AI and finance.

Lem   53:01
Yep.

Peter Wolf   53:02
So if it looks AI ish, that's OK.

Lem   53:06
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   53:08
So I kind of like the little bit longer blurb. That's OK. I'm. I'm fine with that.

Lem   53:08
So yeah, we could actually.
Uh.

Peter Wolf   53:12
Let's go with that approach for now.
But let's do maybe put that green check mark in front of it or something to to make that visual right.

Lem   53:15
OK.
Yeah.
Yep, that's right.
Yeah, we could actually update that one on the formatting on ChatGPT.
Yeah, the the that one would be needs more.
Optimizing because.
It's not getting the right.
The right one for the social media content. I think it's because.
Of the.

Peter Wolf   53:52
Again, this is stuff I think would be valuable.
I think, Peter, you're still on, this is stuff just getting used to this coding aspect to make sure that you can tweak it right.
Putting that into chat, GBD and saying this is a structure I want to bring this closer together tighten these up.

Lem   54:03
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   54:06
How do I make the code changes you got to be you got to be at least.
Competent in understanding what this is, especially if you're trying to say you helped write these these.
Lows to know how to pull this stuff out.
And understand it and and run it through ChatGPT at the very least, you might not have to totally understand it, but to be able to be comfortable to run it through ChatGPT and say let's tweak it. Let's make the lines around these bolder and let's make.

Peter Wolf   54:27
State.
Churches.

Peter Wolf   54:34
The Heather larger.
Let's make the body tighter, right with less spacing.
All those kinds of things, so you understand how to manipulate this output.

Lem   54:41
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   54:42
Ship.

Lem   54:46
Yeah, that's right.
I think we I need to revamp this particular because it's a uniforming the.
All of the.
Output in the middle.
Yeah.
Yeah. So.
But yeah, first, yeah, I think I need to 1st build the one on the AI tools.
So this one.
Reinforce and updates.
Guys, you're still there.

Peter Wolf   56:07
Yeah.

Lem   56:08
OK.

Peter Wolf   56:09
So look, I gotta drop off.

Lem   56:10
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   56:12
But Brian, did we I feel like we said my stuff was working last week, but now it's not working or is it working or what?

Bryan Wolf   56:14
Yeah.
No, no, no, no, no.
You're you're you're tough's good newsletter's good.
LinkedIn Post is good.
I mean, yeah, it's it's working.

Peter Wolf   56:30
OK. Then we'll take a look at that a little bit later.
'Cause I thought I set myself like right now. Let me send myself a message.

Bryan Wolf   56:39
Oh wait.

Lem   56:44
The newsletter plus is that.

Bryan Wolf   56:44
No, it was working. Your yours working.

Peter Wolf   56:51
So if I go to.

Bryan Wolf   56:54
Oh, you know what I think there was.

Peter Wolf   57:01
So we have two different things that I can do from my e-mail, right?
One is, say, research.
Right. And the other one is, do I send it to myself?

Lem   57:09
Yeah, research.

Peter Wolf   57:10
P9 Wolf 9 and then I say research.

Lem   57:11
News newsletter.

Peter Wolf   57:17
And then.
If I have research, he goes into the body content, so I could say research ABC. Nothing to look at here and then I put.
Body content.

Bryan Wolf   57:33
I'll get it figured out. Whatever is.

Peter Wolf   57:36
Contains.
Lots.

Bryan Wolf   57:41
Sitting here looking at it, I think you're right.
I can't remember.

Peter Wolf   57:44
This is why you got to take notes, Brian.
Can't you gotta when there's a problem, you gotta be keeping track of this stuff so we can resolve it. Not trying to figure it out.

Bryan Wolf   57:52
Pretty sure that you have issues.

Peter Wolf   57:54
Well, I know that as of last week I still didn't have this working.

Lem   57:56
For.

Peter Wolf   57:58
So if you thought it was working, then when we discussed it on Friday and we wrapped up, there was nothing that was triggering. When I went into my folder and my outlook and my Gmail in my Google Drive, there was no content being updated.

Bryan Wolf   58:11
No, dad, that's incorrect.
Actually you were getting the content, it was just laid out improperly on Outlook compared to Gmail.

Peter Wolf   58:18
No, that was that was the newsletter, right? OK.

Bryan Wolf   58:21
Yes.

Peter Wolf   58:21
So hold on one second.

Bryan Wolf   58:22
Well, what are you asking her?

Peter Wolf   58:22
So then let me hold on.

Bryan Wolf   58:26
Lincoln.

Peter Wolf   58:27
The Gmail.
The Gmail trigger prompt, right?

Bryan Wolf   58:29
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   58:32
News articles.

Bryan Wolf   58:51
Mm hmm.

Peter Wolf   59:18
OK so.
Here's the content I'm sending.
Yes, I am.
All right, so I just sent myself a research and I put an article.
I don't remember what that exactly is supposed to trigger.
Wasn't it supposed to populate into a spreadsheet for me?
Give a summary.

Lem   59:41
Yep.

Peter Wolf   59:41
All that kind of ****, right?

Lem   59:43
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   59:44
Yep. So if I go to my Google Drive.

Bryan Wolf   59:44
Yeah.

Lem   59:47
It should be on the Google.
Folder which is.

Peter Wolf   59:51
Yeah, that's what we're going for here, Google.

Lem   59:54
It it is mapped.

Peter Wolf   59:58
Go to my Google Drive.
And.
And I don't know what folder let me share my screen.
So.
Research.
I'm it right?
So here's the here's the e-mail I sent.
Did it go out?
Hold on.
Maybe I didn't send it to the right place.
You know.
Really, how the damn thing go.
Ow.
OK.
So now this should be right.
Turn it.
OK.
Well, there's the previous one too, so here's two that I said to myself. Have the word research.
In them, they received it to my e-mail account.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:51
Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.

Peter Wolf   1:04:54
I go to my Google Drive.
Here's the document for research.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:01
Mm hmm.

Peter Wolf   1:05:01
My Google sheet.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:03
I don't even.

Peter Wolf   1:05:03
Last it was update was on 6/18 at 4:34, so it's definitely not working.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:11
OK, I'll figure that out.

Peter Wolf   1:05:14
Can you make sure work through with Lem to get that done?
Make sure it's functioning OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:19
Yep, Yep, Yep.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:05:22
Alright, thanks guys.
I'll talk to you a little bit later.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:26
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:05:27
And then you'll you'll push forward to kinda clean that up.
Straighten it up and what not.
And then I'll put the new milestone out there.
Same thing going forward, right? OK.
Still there, lem.

Lem   1:05:42
Oh, I was muted. Yeah.
OK, Peter.
No problem.

Peter Wolf   1:05:44
OK.
All right.

Lem   1:05:45
Yeah. Still this thing, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:05:45
Thanks guys.
Talk to you later. Bye.

Lem   1:05:49
Give you there.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:50
Alright, lemme.
Let's knock this out real quick.

Lem   1:05:51
Bye.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:55
So I think I had.

Lem   1:05:56
Yeah, maybe it's just the mapping of the.
The Yeah, the spreadsheet.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:00
Honestly, so this is this is the first flow that we worked on, right?

Lem   1:06:04
Yeah, the first flow.
So the one that is research, yeah, because now we have. Yeah. Trigger. Yeah. Trigger. Inbox with the research.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:05
Yeah, I gotta find it.
I don't even think.
Trigger research labeling box.

Lem   1:06:15
Now we have like 2 triggers like the research or the newsletter plus.
So it would be sending on different spreadsheets, so maybe.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:23
Oh, so wait, I I so hold on.
So I have an older version.
Let me see.
Cause here let me also switch or I think I have an older version of the flower.
Have you updated it since so I have the one that's like e-mail to ChatGPT to the router, to perplexity?
And I remember I filled it all out properly.
It just wasn't populating for me.
Let me connect over to my phone right now.
Give me one second here, alright?
I'm gonna.
I'm gonna join right back in, right?

Lem   1:06:51
OK.
OK.
No problem.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:02
OK, cool. Can you hear me alright?

Lem   1:07:04
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:05
Well, I don't.
I think I did this and I didn't save it for him second here.
Then it just.
And to log all this stuff back in the same region.
Alright.

Lem   1:08:12
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:30
So I don't even know if he has.
Oh, no, here it is.
Database research, OK.
So this is the trigger. Yeah. OK, hold on.
How was your weekend, love?

Lem   1:08:52
Yeah, just just stayed home.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:57
Just stay there long time.

Lem   1:08:57
Didn't really went out.
Stayed over.
Just hang out.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:03
I basically did the same thing.
Very boring, you know.

Lem   1:09:07
Yeah, it's always raining here now on Philippines.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:11
Oh really?

Lem   1:09:13
This time, yeah, June, July.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:16
That sucks.

Lem   1:09:17
So yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:20
This up here this weekend was like the first really hot weather.

Lem   1:09:26
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:27
Good weekend.

Lem   1:09:28
Good, good time to go to the beach.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:32
Yeah, my.
Yeah. My, my, my mother's down there now and my.
So is Peter.
But I'm I'm I'm not, unfortunately.
OK.
Alright so.
Alright, so this should work right?
I filled everything out. Shoot.

Lem   1:10:05
Yeah, this is the I think this is the original 1. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:09
Yeah.
So let me see.

Lem   1:10:16
This is on his account.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:18
Yeah. Just on the other, yeah.

Lem   1:10:19
Or.
OK, so I think it's not.
Yeah, because it wasn't triggered.
It was not turned on yet.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:28
No, no, no. I just.
Oh ****.
I just there's two of them down there. ****.
Just the one I just do.

Lem   1:10:39
Yeah, I think this is the one that has the history.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:42
Yes.

Lem   1:10:43
Yeah, it has already some operations.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:44
Yeah.

Lem   1:10:47
Yeah, I think this would, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:47
OK so.
You told me. You told me.

Lem   1:10:52
OK. Did he already send an e-mail? Right.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:55
No, he didn't.
But he was trying to or something.

Lem   1:10:57
Or.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:58
Let's just go to just pick this.
Write this.
To compose.
Right. Just like this, right?

Lem   1:11:19
Yep, that's right, just a link.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:20
Let me turn this.
Let me shut Shads running now.

Lem   1:11:22
The.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:22
Wait till I have to run it after I send it.

Lem   1:11:25
Just send it first and then we could run it.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:29
All right, so there it is, alright.

Lem   1:11:30
Yeah. OK.
And then.
Just run it once.
Yes.
Able to pick it up.
Oh.
Maybe this is different one?
It's taking too long.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:01
It's changed here.

Lem   1:12:03
Can you open the like the?
The yeah, I think this is their wrong one.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:09
Yes.
It's not working.

Lem   1:12:15
Yeah, it's a different one.
So medical research, because it lasts. Yeah, because there's.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:17
Yeah, this is so wait, it might be it.
Might be.
It might just be doing a couple in here.
'Cause, you might have just been.

Lem   1:12:26
Yeah, because there's also research on the.
Subject Line there.
So it was actually processing that one first.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:36
Well this one.

Lem   1:12:38
I know the.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:38
Or down here?

Lem   1:12:40
Yeah, the at the bottom.
Maybe somewhere there?

Bryan Wolf   1:12:44
I think it's another one that he sent to himself.

Lem   1:12:46
Yeah, I yeah, I think I think so.
Oh, there's actually 4.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:56
Yeah. Good.

Lem   1:12:57
Yes.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:00
Let's see.
It's not populated here.

Lem   1:13:02
Uh.
Yeah. Is this the same? Maybe it's a different. The last Google sheet.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:11
I think it is the same.
So is she here?

Lem   1:13:15
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:17
10/1.

Lem   1:13:18
Hmm.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:25
I can make a whole new one.

Lem   1:13:28
No, I just.
Yeah, it's not populating there.
Sheet one.
That's odd.
Can you?

Bryan Wolf   1:13:43
I copy this and make it known.

Lem   1:13:43
Like.
No, just.
Change the name of this database. Research to research to just add 2 so that we could, yeah this one.
And then yeah, just.
Yeah, this one then.
Let's check if it's the same spreadsheet.
And then.
We uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:21
So his thing is this weird thing, right?

Lem   1:14:22
Can you?

Bryan Wolf   1:14:23
I'm just gonna so I don't wanna do this.

Lem   1:14:27
Yeah you can.
It's actually the same. You can ask like search the spreadsheet there.
Yeah, the in.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:35
But it's not populated.

Lem   1:14:35
Yeah, there you can.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:36
You know what I mean?

Lem   1:14:38
You can type database research too. Yeah, there. Maybe it's. Oh, I think it.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:43
But I don't.
I don't think it's updated, you know.

Lem   1:14:44
Yeah, it's.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, but it should. If this is the right.
Spreadsheet. It should be populating.
Maybe there's some delay again.
Yeah, since.
Can you refresh that one?
This connection, just a click there on the connection.
And on the connection there. And no, I just close just on the connection and then click refresh.
Yeah, that there's like a refresh button there. Yep.
Then.
Can you check the spreadsheet idea?
It's not actually. That's odd.
Oh.
Yeah. And also like the Google sheet here are like different from their the.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:55
I do want to.

Lem   1:16:11
No, no, I think we don't need to.
Yeah, we don't need to duplicate.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:15
Hello.

Lem   1:16:16
We just need to.
Double check the Google Drive if.
Where did you put that?
On automation.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:27
So I'm gonna put it in here.

Lem   1:16:30
Oh, maybe that's that's. I think that's why.
Can you go back on?

Bryan Wolf   1:16:34
I'm gonna put it.
It's not.

Lem   1:16:36
The.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:37
It's not actually in this folder, but I'm gonna. I wanna put it in here.
Oh wait, no, it isn't here.
Oh, yeah, you're right, you're right.
Oh, wow. OK. I didn't even realize it was in here.

Lem   1:16:47
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:48
Oh.

Lem   1:16:49
So maybe it's on a different.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:52
I just oh.
I drive.
Automation.
Ah, here we go.

Lem   1:17:06
Oh yeah, I think.
Yeah, that's why.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:08
Here we go.

Lem   1:17:09
Yeah. So I think this would be.

Peter Wolf   1:17:12
Hey guys, I'm heading out.

Lem   1:17:12
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:17:13
I gotta go into work. Brian will connect with you later.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:14
Oh, my God. You're still in this call. What? Yeah. ****.

Lem   1:17:21
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:22
I didn't realize you were still here.

Lem   1:17:26
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:27
I didn't think that was him.

Lem   1:17:28
Database users to.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:30
Yeah. Now it's just for the video.

Lem   1:17:42
I think you can click that one again.
The bubble there.
The number one bubble. Yeah. And then choose where to start.
Yep, then just select the first e-mail so that you won't be getting the others, and then choose the yeah, the one that.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:54
Yeah.

Lem   1:18:00
I think that we have.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:02
Do this one.

Lem   1:18:04
Yeah, I think, yeah, we could that. That's the new one, US1.
Then click run once again.
Uh.
Yeah. OK, then that should populate their already on the.
Google sheet.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:37
OK, we got it working alright.

Lem   1:18:38
Yep, OK.
Yeah. So that's good.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:41
So I'm good then.
I'm I'm chilling, man.
You're the man.
You always get me right.

Lem   1:18:45
Yeah.
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:48
But I'm gonna get off.
I gotta get off, man, you know?

Lem   1:18:51
OK.
No problem.
I'll work on the newsletter, OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:52
Have a good one.
Talk to you tomorrow, alright?

Lem   1:18:55
Yeah. Talk to you soon, Bryan.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:57
See you then. Bye.

Lem   1:18:58
OK.
