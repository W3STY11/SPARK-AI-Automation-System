Lem Quimpo   0:41
Hi, guys. Morning.

Bryan Wolf   0:46
Hi man, how you doing?

Nicholas Westburg   0:47
Morning, guys.
Can you guys hear me?

Lem Quimpo   0:55
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   0:57
Both.

Lem Quimpo   1:06
Let me just.
What?
Bart, I also already used your prompt, so I think I the.
The output was much better also together with the persona of Peter. So yeah, I think.

Bryan Wolf   2:25
Screw it.

Lem Quimpo   2:28
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   2:32
I said I don't think saying.
We're in or was that you that said we're in the other one for uh.
Yeah, for the target market audience.

Lem Quimpo   2:46
Right, right. Yeah. So the target market audience was for the choosing of top three. So it would be, yeah, different persona and yeah, basically we're just using the like the full persona for the creation of the prompts as added.

Bryan Wolf   2:53
Alright.

Lem Quimpo   3:06
Context and then.

Bryan Wolf   3:07
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   3:09
For the other ones.
Uh, you need that target market.

Bartosz Borek   3:18
Sorry, I was talking and I was on mute. So yesterday what I did is I added the summary plus the the kind of commentary of how this relates to corporate finance treasury.

Lem Quimpo   3:22
Um.

Bryan Wolf   3:28
Oops.

Bartosz Borek   3:33
Did we have any samples of because Lemi said that it provides better prompts. Can you do we have like a before and after of something or do we have something we can take a look at or Bryan would that be did you run those prompts or?

Lem Quimpo   3:34
OK.

Bryan Wolf   3:45
I should.
I tried to run. Uh, run it last night. Hold on. If you can pull yours up, baby.

Lem Quimpo   3:49
Yeah.
We could actually.

Bartosz Borek   3:54
OK.

Lem Quimpo   3:55
Yeah, so let me just share my screen. Yes, so we could actually check the like the output because I've tried the.
Last the newest output here. So it's actually using the. The first one is basically just an overview and then the second one like second sentence and third sentence.

Bryan Wolf   4:10
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   4:22
Like the 50 word here is like an angle why it is relevant. So yeah, it's no why it's relevant to the corporate treasury and corporate finance. So it's yeah, it's.

Bryan Wolf   4:29
It's irrelevant, you're saying?
Yeah.
Great.

Lem Quimpo   4:39
Then we're yeah, because we're actually feeding the also the summary in the relevance here from perplexity for the comparison. Let me just not sure if I have the.

Bartosz Borek   4:50
Yeah, just so we could see like a before and after, see if that prompt really did improve things or not.

Bryan Wolf   4:53
I definitely.

Lem Quimpo   4:55
Mhm.
Oh.
Yeah.
I think we I have the last test.

Peter Wolf   5:06
Hey guys, I have something I gotta wrap up. So um, if you guys can push forward for a little bit and I'll try and be back on in say 15 minutes.

Bryan Wolf   5:09
Yeah.
Sure.

Bartosz Borek   5:15
Yeah, sure. No problem.

Peter Wolf   5:17
Alright.

Lem Quimpo   5:20
When was this yesterday?
4.
June 27.
Yeah, so yeah, I think this is much better to compare it. So yes, you can see here it's just much shorter and it's just like a summary for.

Bartosz Borek   5:51
Yeah, it's just OK. So looking at this one, Redwood materials diverts is huge towards the AM transferring these.

Lem Quimpo   5:51
The.

Bartosz Borek   6:03
OK. All right. So how did, how did that be spinned to a if we could check how that now is looking with a treasury or?

Lem Quimpo   6:05
Yeah.
Yes, so.
Yeah, now it looks like this, so.

Bartosz Borek   6:20
OK, so it's not not the same article. OK.

Bryan Wolf   6:22
The content's a lot better, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   6:23
Oh yeah, because these are like new, new articles, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   6:27
Oh, got you. Got you. Sorry. I I thought. I thought we would have the same.

Bryan Wolf   6:28
Yeah, I think I added like a couple of those new RSS feeds in there. I tried to, I don't know if it's actually firing, but so we might be getting better, better data, better, better articles as well. Well, this is for Linus Flow actually, so I'm gonna.

Bartosz Borek   6:34
OK.

Lem Quimpo   6:36
Um.

Bartosz Borek   6:39
Hold on, let's, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   6:41
Yeah, but yeah, I I think compared to.

Bartosz Borek   6:44
Alright, this is already, I mean this is looking better because that first one, the finance lead is getting a header.

Bryan Wolf   6:47
Deloitte.

Lem Quimpo   6:51
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   6:51
OK, yeah, see, this is, um, this is already something that I think is probably, yeah, this is definitely progress.

Bryan Wolf   6:54
Progress.

Lem Quimpo   7:00
Yeah, it's now mentioning like an angle that for like CFOs or like for finance leaders.
For example, this one, the finance leaders getting ahead are those actively piloting AI for treasury operations and leveraging real-time analytics for liquidity decision. So it's yeah, I think the one that really helped also is the relevance and summary from perplexity because.
Last time we're just feeding the summary from the I know reader and then yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   7:30
OK.
Mm-hmm. Perplexity gets a better breakdown of it, I think.

Lem Quimpo   7:39
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, it it actually also I updated the our like spreadsheet. So now we could see the summary here and then we could see also like the relevance. So the summary is much, much shorter, just just 50 word summary and then.

Bryan Wolf   7:46
Uh huh.
Oh, great.

Lem Quimpo   7:56
The relevance is much longer. We'll see like, yeah, something like this. It's much longer.

Bryan Wolf   8:02
Wow, that's really good, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   8:05
I think it's different from Ina reader. Yeah, it is from Ina reader.
And then?
Yeah, so when when I check the output, mostly it's because it's in our prompter. I think the first sentence is like a short summary or overview and then the second one is like the relevance.
And then for example, yeah, this one.
It just I'm not sure if this is like awkward. Like here's the thing if something like this, so if that would be a problem or something. But yeah, there's some.

Bartosz Borek   8:54
That's a little awkward. The the here's the thing. I don't know that's.

Lem Quimpo   8:54
One other Yeah, take this one also. Here's the reality. Something like that. OK.

Bryan Wolf   8:57
Yeah, OK.

Bartosz Borek   9:01
Yeah, that's fine. That that that's fine. Here's the reality. That's because that that's our commentary. The here's the thing that sounds like just slightly a little too casual. But I mean, it's not, it's not bad, but.

Lem Quimpo   9:05
Uh.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   9:13
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   9:18
Yeah, for recovery country is it's.
Uh.
Yeah. And then oh, it's just also for example, not sure how we could because as you can see here like it's using for corporate treasurers, treasurers and then here it's also using for corporate treasurers and then.

Bryan Wolf   9:37
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   9:41
Yeah, uh. And then if we choose like these two, so.
It would be like maybe the reader would kinda read it awkward also because it's be doing the like same thing. I'm not sure also if signals a critical lesson.
Where the shifts means is your integration to yeah, but yeah, the other wordings are different, but I think it is doing this because we are setting telling it in the prompt right that.

Bryan Wolf   10:15
They do Treasury. Yeah, it's almost like not hallucinating, but it's just like being a little bit too exact almost. But I don't think that's really that bad.

Lem Quimpo   10:17
The.
Yeah, it's like too exact, for example.
Uh, where's the?
Yeah, this one, right. Uh, brief summary and then a thoughtful commentary. So.

Bryan Wolf   10:34
That's the core of my answer, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   10:37
Yeah, I'm just not sure if.
Yeah, maybe that's why it's doing this like the same. But yeah, I think The thing is we're just do doing like a little blurb, right? So we can't. I think we cannot, we cannot like.

Bryan Wolf   10:56
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   10:59
Really take out the possibility that some of them will have like a recurring. For example, like this one, here's the thing and then the other one is here's. Here's the thing also, yeah, like other ones would be.

Bryan Wolf   11:07
Language, Korean language, yeah.
Yeah.
You can maybe add that to the rules to fix the language up, but.

Lem Quimpo   11:16
No.
Yeah, we could add like like a barricade for like guard, guard rails for like your assisting, something like that. But what I mean is.
Yeah, this also has. Here's the thing. Yeah, I think we could add more.
Guardrails and then maybe add it to the prompt hole so that it should.
Use different words for like the relevance relevance section.
Yeah, so as you can see for corporate treasurers, this signals A pivotal moment. Then also here it's using that same same exact like like intro on the sentence for corporate treasurers.
Then we also have it here, right on the other ones. I think it's this one.
Yeah, this one for corporate treasures and yeah, the I think the main problem because this is like very short, very short like.

Bryan Wolf   12:21
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   12:31
Paragraph content. So I think it would really be much better if we could have like a sample.

Bryan Wolf   12:36
Is this blurb? This is in the news subsection. I could have found a content here. It said this is just in here. It's maybe not as we would do.

Lem Quimpo   12:40
Yep, that's right. Yeah, it's a news news section.
Yeah, so yeah, what what I was thinking, I I'm not sure also Bart if you also use like the style on the prompting wherein we give like an example then maybe we give give it like a three different.
Format for the blurb and then yeah it will just base the wordings or like the structure there so that uh it would be like.
Um.

Bartosz Borek   13:14
One thing is that like I thought about that doing something like that and if we're gonna have three like few of these blurbs like every week.

Lem Quimpo   13:15
Like.

Bryan Wolf   13:25
Mhm.

Bartosz Borek   13:26
It almost seems like it would become really repetitive because that's one thing that I've noticed with like pretty much any LLM that when you say, oh, put it in the style of this or make it sound like this, then whatever you do going forward is just gonna be exactly like that. And then it seems obvious that it's.

Lem Quimpo   13:27
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   13:37
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   13:38
Yeah, that's right.

Bartosz Borek   13:47
You know, just totally created by.

Lem Quimpo   13:50
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   13:51
That's why I like the persona though, because I feel like when you upload a persona, it's really geared towards a a type of like language, like, you know, a professional type of like, you know, setting or or language or authors. I really don't. I know Peter's is really big, but I feel like in the past before when in the instructions you cite the specific portions.

Bartosz Borek   13:52
Chatbot.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   14:11
The persona you wanted to emulate. It'll actually do that. You'll probably get the same thing of like, you know, the repetitive hallucination, but it almost might be like an acceptable repetitive hallucination.

Lem Quimpo   14:23
Yeah, but but the.

Bartosz Borek   14:25
Yeah, I don't really think that these right here that we're getting are that bad. I think they're actually pretty good considering that they they don't all sound similar. They use kind of like slightly different formatting, so.

Bryan Wolf   14:28
No.

Lem Quimpo   14:41
Yeah. But yeah, I think you're, you're, yeah, they they would see. Yeah, they would see the pattern. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Then you would see. Yeah, basically, yeah, I think that's also like one of the.

Bryan Wolf   14:42
But I also think you're right part in sense for like if this is pushed out for weeks on end, it'll probably it'll then you'll start to notice it for sure.

Bartosz Borek   14:50
Yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   14:58
Like disadvantage just also right of automating stuff because when we instruct of course when we when we instruct like the AI model to do something and then we it would do that particular thing but we can't also say it to for example can.

Bryan Wolf   15:03
Yeah, it's not very personalized.

Lem Quimpo   15:18
Can you do this thing exactly and then do it slightly different each time? So it gets confused when we do something like that. So for example like this one we're like telling it to basically have the same format, right?
Like the brief summary here for the first sentence and then like the commentary 50 word and then if we add in the prompt here that like use different formats like for like every post or something. So I think yeah the LLM won't be getting that like context here that's the.

Bryan Wolf   15:36
Yeah.
Mm.
Operate.

Lem Quimpo   15:53
Like some of the disadvantages also because yeah, I I was also concerned about that Bart because like for the relevance, right, we we wouldn't. Yeah, basically we it would have like.

Bryan Wolf   15:58
There.

Lem Quimpo   16:09
The same wordings here, but on the last like what what we did last time was just a summary overview. So the actually the output there was much like different because for of course the yeah.

Bartosz Borek   16:22
Yeah, because it would just be this, yeah, obviously it would be the summary I'm based on.

Lem Quimpo   16:25
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, the articles, yeah. But this one is we are actually feeding it and saying feeding the persona and then also saying it to like make an angle that connects it to the corporate corporate pressure. So I think that's why the pattern here is you can actually see like the pattern right there.

Bartosz Borek   16:35
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   16:43
For every like for every output of uh like every content. So yeah, that's like the pros and cons also I think.

Bartosz Borek   16:51
But I mean, but but the pattern makes sense though, because that's what we wanted to do, right? We want it initially to give it a summary and then give an opinion. So the everywhere you every time you have that, I think it's gonna be a summary and an opinion, so.

Bryan Wolf   16:55
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   16:56
Yeah.
Yep. Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, yeah, I think that's right. I'll just add, I think, a guardrails here for the Here's the thing.

Bartosz Borek   17:11
Like I I don't know it's it's.

Bryan Wolf   17:13
I think it's that bad, like, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   17:16
I mean, it's doing exactly what we want it to do. So I mean, maybe the problem is it maybe it sounds, maybe it doesn't sound human enough, or maybe it sounds too human.

Bryan Wolf   17:18
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   17:19
Yeah, yeah, actually.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   17:26
Yeah, that's what I think. It just sounds very, you know, generated. It's it's hard. We wanna get almost more personalized. But I think it's also kind of just sort of comes to hand in hand with the automating all this stuff.

Lem Quimpo   17:34
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   17:39
Now here's the thing though, it's.
When it's kind of actually acting pretty human, because people tend to have certain ways of like typing and writing and talking, people tend to repeat themselves. So maybe this is.

Lem Quimpo   17:54
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   17:59
Actually not that bad. Maybe this is fine.

Bryan Wolf   18:02
Mhm.
It's definitely a lot better than our other like rough drop copies.

Lem Quimpo   18:10
Yeah, the other ones were just like a summary and then doesn't have like the angle, for example, like, yeah, the relevance to the audience. So it's, yeah, it's actually also hard because.

Bartosz Borek   18:14
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   18:25
This is just like very short and then like the LLM also what? Yeah what I'm thinking here is like the LLM has like certain words that it it is it uses when like like for example this is very short right? So.
It it can't use some other words for explaining like the stuff that we want it to because it's just very short if that makes sense. But if for example we are gonna write like a full blog, right? I think the.
Like the content would be much it would be different for every like articles yes. So I think that's why like but yeah basically I I I agree also on what you said Bart on the like the pattern other person also I think we we just need to like you humanize this.

Bartosz Borek   19:16
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   19:18
Add to the prompt like that to like make it more human like the wordings. But I'm I'm not sure also because maybe it would say like for example like the here's the thing like very casual. So I think we need to like.

Bryan Wolf   19:20
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   19:33
Because if we said that use professional tone, of course it would use like for example like the the words that it will use are much more professional, right? Like not simple words. But if we say tell it to use like a casual also like humanize it so.
I'm not also sure if what the impact would be so, but yeah.
So, yeah, so basically that's the.
Other one, yeah, I think that's the main main content that yet we need to update because for the other ones I think these are just like the summary for the socials.
And then also for the conclusions, I've also added there the.
The like the persona and then use Claude also also for the the.

Bryan Wolf   20:32
Uh huh.

Bartosz Borek   20:34
All right. So I mean, in in my opinion, I think that we should probably.
Continue with this, maybe run iterations because I mean, Peter wants this to be live on Friday, right? He wants this to be released this week. So how far off are we from getting this up and running?

Lem Quimpo   20:46
Yep.
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   20:48
For sure. Yeah.
I think for for me personally like I think just getting the rest of the like the source material to like you know be better to pull from like all those sources that Peter had sent and I think you had sent some to Bart or I'm mistaken but getting all those implemented into into into my make.

Lem Quimpo   20:57
Uh.

Bartosz Borek   20:57
Like.
He he actually, yeah, he he did a compiled. Yeah, he did a compiled list, so.

Bryan Wolf   21:16
Yeah. So I got some of those in some of the other ones. I still have to integrate into it, but I think once you do that, this material's already much more improved from like our last previous weeks. But once we get that in there and then maybe 11 and I can work on just, you know, adding a little bit more into the prompt, I think.

Bartosz Borek   21:19
OK.

Bryan Wolf   21:35
We'll be really, really close though.

Lem Quimpo   21:36
Yeah, I'm also for this one like the the Serrala Daily Insights. So I'm not sure like the content what the content would be here because Peter also last time was also like deciding.

Bartosz Borek   21:38
OK.

Bryan Wolf   21:39
We're already really close, but definitely by Friday.
Alright.

Lem Quimpo   21:53
What to put in here? So I'm not sure also if like where to pull this from. So I was just adding this as a placeholder coming from like the Serrala like blog post I think Serrala let me just.

Bryan Wolf   22:00
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   22:06
Yeah, so daily insights, I think I know where daily insights.

Bryan Wolf   22:06
Oh.

Lem Quimpo   22:11
Yeah it's it was actually a coming from the like the website but it's not really like A blog post. I think this is just one. I think it was on your services or something.

Bartosz Borek   22:11
Well, let me uh.

Bryan Wolf   22:12
OK.
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   22:16
Done.
So this is a good.
Well, this is a good question because now it's gonna.

Lem Quimpo   22:29
Yeah, yeah. And also for the upcoming events. So what I did, yeah, because on our last meeting on this one, what we were planning to do is to add here like the that's why they we have the automation for this one also like to add the blog here or.
The website and also like for the upcoming events, so add the website here and then the automation would be the one who will create like the overview. So yeah that's the thing also. So as you can see here I would just I just added the serral.com events so these are like 2 the same links.

Bryan Wolf   22:50
Mhm.

Bartosz Borek   22:50
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   23:05
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   23:08
Yeah, yeah. So let let let me show you one of the problems I have with this. Can I steal the screen share for a second? So all right.

Lem Quimpo   23:08
As a placeholder, so.
OK. Yep. OK.

Bartosz Borek   23:19
Go on our website, right? You go to sarala.com/knowledge center.
This is going to have everything, right? But we don't want everything. So if we actually Scroll down, you can filter by solutions. So what we would need is to filter by treasury management. But the problem is, is when you filter by treasury management, it doesn't really take you to a separate website.

Bryan Wolf   23:39
Mhm.

Bartosz Borek   23:46
It's still in the knowledge center, so I don't know how the hell we would do that. And then plus you got to like do a lot of clicking around. So you have these are all articles that we submitted and I think this should be part of the, you know, Treasury insights type thing because we see we, you know all of these are from.

Lem Quimpo   23:46
Mm.

Bryan Wolf   23:48
Mhm.
Hello.

Bartosz Borek   24:05
This year and we have quite a bit of these white papers and different treasury things. So yeah, I just, I just don't know how we're going to do that. Yeah, I'll, I'll.

Lem Quimpo   24:10
OK, so it's on resources.
Oh yeah, this is on on the knowledge center.

Bartosz Borek   24:18
I'll put it in the chat here.
So I don't know how that would work. I'm trying to think how that would work. So you just filter by.
I'll put the screenshot in here as well.
So you just filter by that treasure management thing.

Lem Quimpo   24:39
Mm.
Um.

Bartosz Borek   24:43
I mean, if we can't then.
It's not the end of the world, right? Because all of this other stuff is internal Serrala stuff, but it kind of helps some of the other departments out and not specifically our Treasury Services practice. So yeah, that was one thing that I saw as a potential issue.

Bryan Wolf   24:58
Mhm.

Bartosz Borek   25:06
And.

Lem Quimpo   25:07
Management. OK And then we add, we click the read more. So it would. Oh, OK, yeah, I see.
Uh.

Bartosz Borek   25:16
Yeah, you really had. There's a lot of clicking here. So then when you click read more, it takes you to a totally different, you know, website. And then some of this is like, you know, you have to download stuff, so.

Bryan Wolf   25:27
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   25:31
Mm yeah.

Bartosz Borek   25:32
Some of these are what you call like gated, gated documents where to read more. Yeah, to read more you have to like.

Bryan Wolf   25:36
Yeah, I won't be able to bull from him at all, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   25:42
Quote UN quote register for.

Bryan Wolf   25:42
I mean, out of outline, this is. I don't know if you can think of a way to pull this in to make it all, but.

Lem Quimpo   25:50
Yeah, it would be basically this would be like a data scraping, but actually what we could also do like we could shuffle them, but of course it would be pretty static. So like we would add like some of the like best.

Bartosz Borek   25:51
Like, not all of it. Some of it is really good. Some of it is really good.

Bryan Wolf   25:55
Yeah, I was gonna say I wonder if we could just scrape it.

Lem Quimpo   26:09
Blogs here for example like 10 and then we would shuffle it to the like like yeah, basically shuffle three of the pick randomly three of the blogs and then that's the one that it would put on the.

Bartosz Borek   26:12
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   26:26
But it wouldn't be just like the 10 that we picked because I feel like this is important because it's like so up to date and it's just current news or or you know, updated stuff. So we'll be able to like recycle that 10 out for the newest 10 every month that there it's produced or every couple weeks it's produced.

Lem Quimpo   26:26
No.
Oh yeah.
Yeah, so yeah, because for this one you would need to basically like scrape it every time. And I'm not, I'm not sure if that would be like efficient because for example you have, let me just, yeah, you have like the last post here was like on June 18, right? And then.

Bryan Wolf   27:04
Oh.

Lem Quimpo   27:04
Last prose from that is May 28th so it's like every two weeks or three weeks. So what I'm thinking also like also Bart said that others here are like have some gated something but or not treasure but yeah something like that so.

Bryan Wolf   27:08
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Not treasury based. Yeah. Oh.

Bartosz Borek   27:19
Yeah, they're not. Yeah, they're not really ours.

Lem Quimpo   27:21
Because if we would like scrape this one, it would also like cost have another cost of course if we do that one and then basically we're we're scraping it, but we're we're not getting anything from it because it's not like updated daily, right. So I think it would be much efficient if.

Bryan Wolf   27:29
Yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   27:41
For example, there's a new blog, we would just manually create that one again and add to the like for example 10 or 15 articles and then we could also like we could also do like not a random.

Bryan Wolf   27:49
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   27:58
One, but they do manually choose it on our spreadsheet. If that, yeah, let me share my screen. Sephora. Yeah, so we have here.

Bryan Wolf   28:05
Right. I know what you're saying.

Lem Quimpo   28:12
This one right for STS blog posts. So we could already have put here the links because yeah like for example we would put here like the 15 or like 20 links and then.

Bryan Wolf   28:16
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   28:27
That like the old ones and then we could just shuffle like use three here and then like choose the like choose the.

Bryan Wolf   28:31
Which one do you wanna choose? Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   28:39
Like the, yeah, the other ones. And then whenever there's a new one, so we could add it to the.
That like to the news newsletter. But yeah, I think it it wouldn't be very efficient if we would also build like a system to scrape the particular website if that, yeah, if you yeah. And then so the only thing here is we would need to like manually like.

Bryan Wolf   28:50
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   29:05
Like of course we could also use like AI right like to or Claude to like feed the whole article and then create the overview or something and then we we'll just manually add like the links here for the events. So as you can see for example this one so we could no.
Sample this one the ISO 20/22 so we could also add it here and then So what will happen is whenever we click that one right so it would like the our system would just process and get the overview and the blog title. So yeah that's how would.

Bryan Wolf   29:29
Yeah.
I think that's a good idea.

Lem Quimpo   29:39
Yeah, I think because, yeah, if we scrape it this website, yeah, I think that would like cost another one and then maybe like the output here won't be like, yeah, efficient as as that one. So yeah, that's also my idea on it. And of course we could also do.

Bryan Wolf   29:49
Is efficient.

Lem Quimpo   29:59
The same on the upcoming events because of especially these upcoming events because you I'm not sure if you guys have like a week every week you have a new event. So that would also like not I think that would be very efficient if you would like scrape also like the the website for.

Bryan Wolf   30:01
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   30:19
An event like every day or every weekend. You guys doesn't don't have an week events.

Bartosz Borek   30:23
No, it's it's not. It's it's not that often that we have events, so.

Lem Quimpo   30:28
So So what we could also do is yeah, basically the same. We could list the events here and then like the best events that you have in the past and then or like the upcoming ones and then we could just choose it to add on the. But yeah, we would need to like manually add this one or something.
Um.
Yeah, so.
Yeah, I think that's how I would approach it. And of course we could also like I think automate how to, but basically if it's static it, it's not really needed to like build a system on it. So we could just have like a list here, right? Then for example like after.
After one month you would have a new event, so we could just put the event and like get put it on ChatGPT or Claude and then make an overview for it then to add on the article. So yeah, I'm not sure if that makes sense.
Uh.
So.
Um.
Yeah, because I I also want to just also note Bart that we have this particular system that was connected to that like as the events and blog post, but we're just using like ChatGPT here for the we could also use like perplexity and then.

Bryan Wolf   31:51
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   31:58
It would find the like the current events for that particular website like the Serrala events and the only thing here is it's not really outputting very good so.
Um, yeah, the output for that one is not, uh, very.
Um, good. So.
Yeah, for example this one. So I think this was this is like the same, the same.
Event. So ChatGPT actually got like the same events, but a like a different, yeah, like a different, just different wordings on it.

Bryan Wolf   32:40
Oh, really? Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   32:45
Uh, but yeah, that's how I would. Um.
So just I'm not sure also if oh yeah, it was here. Yeah, I was feeding this particular event because you don't have like.
Oh yeah, yeah. So you actually have this one here, but yeah, basically we.
Yeah, I think we could scrape this also one by one.
But yeah, what do you think about it, guys, on that case?
So these are all upcoming.

Bartosz Borek   33:46
Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I'm not sure what, uh.
What Peter's gonna want to do there? Because again, we don't have that many.
We don't have that many. Uh.

Lem Quimpo   34:03
Events. Yep.

Bartosz Borek   34:05
Events. So I'm not sure if it's worth it to build a web scraper or as if we just kind of like manually update it.

Lem Quimpo   34:10
Yeah, that's that's right. Because, yeah, because for example like this, you have just like 4 up to this for up to 2026, right? So we could easily like input it here right on our spreadsheet. So we don't need to like manually scrape this like every day or something.

Bryan Wolf   34:19
Mhm.
Yeah.
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   34:27
So yeah, I think that and then also of course like the overview, it's much more controlled. So we could like edit it to the to make the tone or like the much better not coming from like the AI or something. But of course we could also use Cloud for that. But yeah, I think that would be.
Much better for just the two of this like the Sarala articles and the upcoming events. So yeah, basically we we would just like create the initial list here for like with the overview coming from the article and then.

Bryan Wolf   34:49
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   34:59
Yeah, we could just, uh, shuffle it and add the new ones.

Bryan Wolf   35:02
I think that sounds good. We should try and do that.

Lem Quimpo   35:03
But yeah, that's OK, yes. So I'll yeah, I'll try to build this. Yeah, STS blog post with the most current ones, maybe like 10 to 15 articles here.

Bartosz Borek   35:20
Yeah, yeah, let me know how that, uh.

Lem Quimpo   35:20
And then?
Yeah and then.
Yeah, because yeah, I think not sure also if Peter already has like an idea on that one, but I think, yeah, that he really wanted to have like a section to put the audience on the.
On your website. So like like some kind of call to action, right. So that's why it does like Serrala daily insights and also like the upcoming events. So like, yeah, so yeah, I think that's how we could do that one.

Bryan Wolf   35:45
Oh.

Lem Quimpo   36:04
And then for the prom also.
Yeah, what we talked about also here last time was Peter just wanted to build this also manually because when we use AI, AI is just like giving like generic prompts and not really like.
You wanted to it to be like pretty like comprehensive and stuff that is of course in line with corporate treasury and corporate finance. So.
Yeah, that's why this is the and then the system that we have is was like different because what he wanted was to.

Bartosz Borek   36:53
Guys, one second. I need one minute. One minute. Sorry.

Lem Quimpo   36:55
OK.

Bryan Wolf   36:56
Good.

Lem Quimpo   36:57
I wanted to search for like the viral prompts, so most of the viral prompts are really not on corporate finance and stuff. So I think we need to tweak this one to, yeah, create.

Bryan Wolf   37:07
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   37:13
Uh.
Prompt this more inline.
With the.
With corporate finance and stuff, yeah, OK. But yeah, I think that's it. So this is the more the upcoming events and then the daily insights.

Bryan Wolf   37:34
It it has improved a lot. I'm happy with improvements, man, but so for the market audience though, is that what you were saying for the Sorella events at the bottom, like that's what he wanted in there, like a Section 4 target audience?

Lem Quimpo   37:38
The.

Bryan Wolf   37:50
Alright, you're talking completely different about the actual events.

Lem Quimpo   37:51
Uh, the target audience. So it was actually here on the one that is choosing the top three articles.

Bryan Wolf   37:59
Yeah, alright.

Lem Quimpo   38:01
So you wanted to, yeah.
To like add a different persona here that it's not the persona, but yeah, just the target market definition and then.

Bryan Wolf   38:09
Mhm.
True line.
Yeah, OK.

Lem Quimpo   38:35
Yes.

Bryan Wolf   38:42
How many of those scenarios did you change? Just one? Just the I narrator or you did a couple on there?

Lem Quimpo   38:48
The for this one I've.

Bryan Wolf   38:52
'Cause you sent me, you sent me nine, you added nine and you gave me two and three, right? Let's check here.

Lem Quimpo   38:56
Yep.
Yeah, that's right. Um.

Bryan Wolf   39:03
Yeah, no, you sent me 1-2 and nine. Yeah. Yeah. So I already updated those. I don't know.

Lem Quimpo   39:06
So.

Bryan Wolf   39:10
Anymore, I guess you're gonna do one other.

Lem Quimpo   39:10
Yeah, so I think I would. Oh, you already connected that to #2 also.

Bryan Wolf   39:17
Yes, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   39:19
Oh I I see. I think yes. So I I was checking it a while ago and then outputted the tested the cool flow. So I think you just need to map it like a different here because we added two columns.

Bryan Wolf   39:34
Yeah, OK.

Lem Quimpo   39:36
So as you can see here on the subsection content, it was actually mapped here on F So it yeah, it was actually sending the summary but not the final content. So this new subsection final content is coming from the cloud.

Bryan Wolf   39:41
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   39:52
So yeah, this is the one that I've just updated it and then also here on the this one, so here on the aggregate, so all all all on the aggregate data on subsection. So that is coming from the filtered articles, so the filtered articles and then this is the aggregated data. Just change this one.

Bryan Wolf   40:02
Uh.
Yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   40:11
So yeah, the column new subsection, final content. And then yeah, this one also. So this one. Yep, the same. So a while ago it was on summary.

Bryan Wolf   40:23
OK.
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   40:37
This one with my own. So it actually was able to get three of my posts. So I've added Yep, that's right. So added three of my posts and then yeah, this is like the handle like x.com handle. Then we could add More handles here.

Bryan Wolf   40:41
That's your Twitter right there. That right there.
OK.
Right, but so is that scraping from your profile or that's 10? I'm seeing so 10 profiles. Now what 10 profiles are you choosing from now? Like how are you?

Lem Quimpo   40:56
Um.
Yeah, J.
Yeah, we yeah, we could. We could add here like More profiles, for example Elon Musk or.

Bryan Wolf   41:07
Well, I see it says profiles desired. Yeah. OK, so that's what you would do. OK, all right.

Lem Quimpo   41:10
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Handles. And then the only thing is, yeah, Peter also gave US, like a list yesterday. So I've checked them one by one, but all of them are not really posting. Some of them are like, not real accounts. And some of them, yeah, some of them are.

Bryan Wolf   41:21
No.
Yeah, outdated. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We can do some research into better, better content.

Bartosz Borek   41:31
Yeah, I think we need probably like 10 good Twitter things we could use.

Lem Quimpo   41:32
Yeah.
Yeah, I was also, The thing is on Twitter, most of them are really like focusing on just one niche. So I'm not sure if some of the guys on finance have content that is.
Yeah, maybe some intersection with technology, but I'm not sure if we have because I've also researched a while ago because I wanted also to test it here on the scraper. So I wasn't, yeah, I was having a hard time researching.
The ones that are like mixing like the intersection of finance and AI, it's mostly on Twitter, they focus on the niche, just AI or like like finance, just pure finance. So yeah, I think that would also be the one here. But yeah, basically we now we could the system is already set up.

Bryan Wolf   42:10
Uh huh.
Yeah.
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   42:24
Up so we could add the. Of course we already have the LinkedIn, then the Twitter, then I just for the Reddit I just.
Like disable it for the meantime and then yeah, I think that's it. Then we already have the AI automation tools, viral prompts.
Yeah, so the main thing here would be this one, the Serrala Daily Insight. So I'm not sure if that would be a good idea, but I'll try to work on it also to have like a database here of the articles and then.

Bartosz Borek   43:04
Yeah, let's. I don't know how that's gonna work. So here's the problem with that database is they're really slow to update it. So this is pretty much all content that my team comes up with and we send it over to, you know, to our marketing team and then they take their typically their sweet *** time before.

Bryan Wolf   43:16
OK.

Lem Quimpo   43:22
OK.

Bryan Wolf   43:22
Yeah.
Yeah, we know how that goes.

Bartosz Borek   43:23
Before they actually upload. Yeah, before they actually upload. Because, you know, they change like the formatting. They make it a certain way. They, you know, there's a copywriter who goes and apparently he does something. Either he ruins the article or he, you know.

Lem Quimpo   43:26
Oh, I see.

Bryan Wolf   43:30
Yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   43:32
Mm OK.

Bartosz Borek   43:39
Whatever, whatever they do, not going to comment more, but so really it's like I feel like this would we can't just have 10 articles. We would have to somehow think of a way where.

Lem Quimpo   43:42
OK.

Bryan Wolf   43:44
Uh.

Bartosz Borek   43:57
We can just easily add a link to that list.
Because every article eventually, yeah, just like add a link. Anytime we have a new article that we want to potentially rotate, we can just manually even add that link. And yeah, if we could think about.

Lem Quimpo   44:01
Add the link here, right?
Yep.
Oh yeah, yeah, I think that would work, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   44:10
Well, Lem, did we do that with. Oh, yeah, man, we can do it, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   44:14
Like how can we do that in a way that's very pain free for like for us?

Bryan Wolf   44:20
I think we had a a capability where you could e-mail the link to yourself with a trigger word where it would. Lem, is that possible? We have that old flow where you can do that with.

Lem Quimpo   44:24
Uh.

Bartosz Borek   44:25
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   44:28
Yeah, yeah, but we we actually already have a flow that is researching the link, so I think that would.

Bryan Wolf   44:36
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   44:37
So we would just have to go into like this Google Drive, this Google Sheet and just add a link. That's not too bad.

Lem Quimpo   44:39
Uh.
Yep, that's right. Yeah. So we would add the link here and then we would press this one, the create summary from the blog post link and then yeah, one of the. Yeah, that's right. So one of the.

Bryan Wolf   44:48
That's it, yeah. And then it populates on the actual newsletter.

Bartosz Borek   44:49
OK, yeah.
I think right now, like a list of just, you know, all of these would probably be good.

Lem Quimpo   44:59
OK, yeah. So yeah, for the.

Bartosz Borek   45:01
Yeah, I I can't think. I'm thinking of the easiest way, like the most pain-free way without like building something, because it's not going to be that often where we have changes to this stuff. It's probably only going to be like once or twice a month. They're going to add new articles and if they're adding new articles once or twice a month, if once a month we have.

Bryan Wolf   45:09
Yeah.
Yeah, OK.

Bartosz Borek   45:21
To go into a sheet and then just make a small little update. That's not very painful for me.

Bryan Wolf   45:23
Press it. Press code buttons, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   45:24
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   45:28
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   45:28
Yeah, yeah, I think, yeah, I think that would be much better. Yeah, the I'll just add the links here of the most recent ones and then yeah, we could just incorporate this one. We actually already have the automation for the like.
The creation of the summary of the blog post. But yeah, what I was also thinking there was this is also just creating the summary. So maybe we could also like, I'm not sure if that's the main content that we want also there, but yeah, basically the automation is.
It's just summarizing the like the whole article and then yeah, creating A blog titles. So but yeah, we yeah, that would work. Yeah, like for the links here and then we could just process one by one.

Bartosz Borek   46:15
OK.
All right, so do are you comfortable going and getting those or do you need do you? Would you want me to give you a list of them?

Lem Quimpo   46:26
Uh.
For yeah, you could also give me the list of like the relevant blogs because I'm not also too sure of.

Bartosz Borek   46:35
OK, I'll give you, I'll, I'll provide, I'll e-mail you the the list that that's that'll be easier. Yeah, it's just it's easier. I mean I know this stuff a little more so this is probably all like a foreign language to you so.

Bryan Wolf   46:38
Awesome. Awesome.

Lem Quimpo   46:39
OK. OK. Yeah, yeah, that would be also helpful.
Yeah, uh.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So yeah, just the links and then yeah, we could process that one one by one. And then, Yep, also for the upcoming events. So I'm not sure also if you would do the same.

Bryan Wolf   46:49
Mhm.

Bartosz Borek   46:51
Yeah.
OK, so all right, all right, so.

Lem Quimpo   47:05
Because basically what? Um, just I'll check the events.
But I think we could also.

Bartosz Borek   47:12
I think we would always, we would always promote the most upcoming event. I don't know that's that's just what makes sense to me, but.

Lem Quimpo   47:15
OK.

Bryan Wolf   47:17
Yes.

Lem Quimpo   47:18
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   47:24
Right. I mean, you're not going to promote or talk about an event of the past. Yeah, it would always be what's the most upcoming event. So, so here we have two upcoming events. We have one in English and then we have one in German, so.

Lem Quimpo   47:26
Yeah, like this one, right?
Yep.
OK.
Uh, yeah, this one, right? OK.

Bartosz Borek   47:44
Actually, we have three upcoming events. ****. We have like, wow, we have a lot.

Lem Quimpo   47:48
September.

Bartosz Borek   47:49
All right. So maybe it's maybe it's not as easy as I imagined. Maybe they do more. Maybe the marketing and sales team do more than I expected.

Bryan Wolf   48:01
Talking.

Lem Quimpo   48:01
Oh yeah.

Bartosz Borek   48:04
Yeah, let's, um, let's go with that right now that we're gonna.
promote whatever is highlighted on the website.

Bryan Wolf   48:14
OK.

Bartosz Borek   48:15
And then let's ask Peter what what his intention is there, because I honestly, I'm not sure.

Lem Quimpo   48:16
OK.
OK, yeah, yeah, I'll, I'll update the.
The scraping of yeah the tool for this one because we actually also have a tool for that one that basically the same with the blog post. It's checking the particular link and then creating the I'll just update it to perplexity and.
I think it's much better finding the particular like event and then yeah, basically it would be the same. So we would just add the links here for the upcoming events and then yeah, manually add the link here and then process it.
Here just so that you would create the overview, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   49:01
OK. And then there was one thing there's hold on, there was something else I wrote down. Lem, you made you sent an e-mail that you need the target market audience persona style document.

Bryan Wolf   49:13
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   49:14
Yeah, um, here for the.

Bartosz Borek   49:16
Who's working on that?

Lem Quimpo   49:19
Um, not sure if I think Brian, uh, are you working on that Brian on the?

Bryan Wolf   49:25
I could listen, I could. So I'm assuming that's what Peter wants. Peter wants a section there for the audience. I could ChatGPT and and get very close. Obviously Bart and and Gill and and and Peter have a much better sense of like directly the audience we want to attack and pull from, but I could.

Lem Quimpo   49:27
Thank you, Mario.

Bartosz Borek   49:31
OK.

Lem Quimpo   49:31
Yeah, the target mark.

Bryan Wolf   49:45
Do that right. But you know, today I could definitely get that done, so.

Bartosz Borek   49:46
Yeah, just um.
Yeah, so if that if that has to be done before we go live, let's let's work on that. And obviously whatever you come up with, just ping me and I'll tell you. Yeah, I'll get, I'll give you my input. So that's not a problem.

Bryan Wolf   49:58
You guys can give your input, yeah.
Great.

Lem Quimpo   50:04
OK, but yeah, where are we here on the also is the output for the news articles already kinda good or we would need to like update it more?

Bryan Wolf   50:17
I think so. Already seen Deloitte and other stuff. You also have to understand that once I get all these, the rest of the honor reader stuff from the RSS feed incorporated, I think it will be totally fine because this is already such a huge improvement.

Lem Quimpo   50:26
Yeah.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   50:37
Back from you.

Lem Quimpo   50:38
Yeah, what what to include? Because we have like from Iron reader we have three daily and then from like perplexity actually is spitting out ten articles per day. So we could we actually have like a different.
Uh, different articles to choose from here. So yeah, we could basically check. Just check the.

Bryan Wolf   50:59
You just get to pick and choose what content you actually want on the news hour, which I really like.

Lem Quimpo   51:01
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. So I think, yeah, that's it. And then.
Yeah, so basically all this good today's insights. Yeah, the finance news, the trending socials. Yeah, for so for the socials.

Bryan Wolf   51:12
I think we're definitely in a good position to finish this by the end of the week.

Lem Quimpo   51:25
I think we could just need to check the Twitter accounts for that one, but the LinkedIn ones actually has like very good, very good content.
Oh.
Yeah, and then AI tools and updates.
And then, Yep, I think, yeah, really, we're gonna finalize this now.
Go In advance.
Oh, this is good.
Uh.
Oh, right, Brian, on the LinkedIn one, so the accounts was, it's already good, right? Like the list that we have.

Bryan Wolf   52:52
In the scraper, I mean, yeah, that's just stuff that I think Peter's gonna have a, uh, a better grasp on what content he wants to pull from.

Lem Quimpo   52:54
Yeah.
I.
Oh, OK, yeah, 'cause I think this one's from.

Bryan Wolf   53:02
This is just like the Twitter one where you're just uploading accounts.

Lem Quimpo   53:06
Yeah, that's right. But uh, these ones are also like a uh.
Individual accounts on LinkedIn, but this is coming from I think Nick. Uh yeah, this was like Nick's list on the we have here like that.

Bryan Wolf   53:14
Yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   53:23
20 I think 20 persons.
The persons.
But yeah, so for the Twitter, yeah, I'm gonna research for that one.
And then yeah, so the yeah, I also want to confirm like that trending on socials also like the it's just the overview is just good, right? Like one I I think, yeah, I actually changed this to the one sentence overview.
Because yeah, Peter wanted also to like make it shorter, but yeah, just an overview. So it's like an overview summary. So I think.
Uh, that's what you wanted. Uh, same as this one, like a one sentence overview.

Bryan Wolf   54:15
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   54:18
And then?

Bartosz Borek   54:19
Brian, I just, I just In this chat, I just kind of started a persona, I think.

Bryan Wolf   54:23
Yeah.
OK, great.

Bartosz Borek   54:27
I think this is, yeah, you could take this, take it In the chat and expand on it, but I think it's good to have just something that's fairly general that you know, gives you a good starting point.

Bryan Wolf   54:35
Oh yeah, totally. Definitely.
Absolutely.

Bartosz Borek   54:42
I don't know. I don't know how detailed we want the persona to be, but this should.

Lem Quimpo   54:44
OK.

Bryan Wolf   54:46
I mean, that's pretty, that's pretty spot on right there. I think Bart, like to be honest with you.

Bartosz Borek   54:49
Yeah, that's exactly what we would be looking for. So yeah, I don't know where that has to go, but if you want to enhance that or make it better or whatever, you just want to make sure that these things are there for the most part, because this is the type of person that would tend to read our material, right? So.

Bryan Wolf   54:52
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   54:54
OK.

Bryan Wolf   54:56
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   55:01
OK.

Bartosz Borek   55:06
Yeah.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   55:10
Yep. OK. Yeah, I'll, I'll incorporate this one also on the, yeah, target market persona.

Bartosz Borek   55:15
All right.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   55:21
And then, yeah, I think, uh, that's basically it. And um, for the content.

Bartosz Borek   55:27
And then sorry, you were you were just sorry. Well, I wasn't paying attention. I was multitasking. What did you just say that you need a summary for what section? The AI tools?

Lem Quimpo   55:35
Yeah, so yeah, like yeah, I wanted to confirm if like the content here would just be because I change actually updated this now to just one sentence. So for this one still.
Oh yeah, two sentence. So just one sentence like overview if that's OK. So it's just like a summary overview and then the same with the AI tools, AI tools.

Bartosz Borek   55:53
OK.

Bryan Wolf   55:58
Yeah, I think that's great.

Bartosz Borek   56:01
Yeah, it's funny. It's it's funny. He uses finance Leaders In every single.
In every single summary, finance leaders, this highlights is crucial, mostly it's crucial for finance and treasury. Actually it doesn't because the second one says finance and treasury executives. Finance Leaders should consider how such.

Lem Quimpo   56:07
Uh.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   56:14
Oh, yeah, OK.

Lem Quimpo   56:16
OK.

Bryan Wolf   56:23
That's just another case of that repetitive language from our instructions and prompting.

Bartosz Borek   56:23
I think, yeah, exactly, exactly. I mean.

Lem Quimpo   56:25
Yeah.
Yeah, because I think the yeah, we added on the prompt also to like add the.
Uh, how it is relevant on the?

Bryan Wolf   56:37
We can keep tweaking it.

Bartosz Borek   56:38
Yeah, yeah, that's fine that that that's OK. That's I don't even, I don't even think that's that bad.

Lem Quimpo   56:40
Yeah.
Uh.
Yeah, like how relevant it is on the. Let me just check also. But basically I didn't. I think I would add a next like a claude step there. Yeah, so we're using just using the ChatGPT on.
On the.
Um, let me just check.
So this one is on training socials.
My, my person. Yeah, it's just the one with this, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   58:01
Alright, I'm paying Peter to see if he can hop back in there, but we'll see.

Bartosz Borek   58:04
Alright, cool. Yeah.
So for the most part, we're pretty good. Yeah, we just got a few small things to OK, a few small things to work on and we should be good for Friday, right?

Lem Quimpo   58:23
Oh yeah, I think that's that's from the Reddit one.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   58:34
Definitely, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   58:36
So the the prompts are looking good, the the output is looking good. We have a persona for the consumer.

Lem Quimpo   58:37
Yeah.
Yeah, for the also when we send it to Brevo, so I think yeah Brian would need to add the your list or yeah the e-mail on the e-mail list or maybe for not sure also on.

Bryan Wolf   58:57
The e-mail.
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   59:05
Who you guys are gonna send it to? But yeah, basically it's on the Bravo site, not on the automation site. So yeah, just.

Bryan Wolf   59:06
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's something we'll really have to. That actually might be a huge problem we'll run into. I don't really know if it's because we have the pro version, but Bravo's always very slow. I don't know if it's gonna be able to handle like an entire client list of emails, but we'll have to figure that out when we get there.

Lem Quimpo   59:18
Yeah.
Yeah, I think yeah, it's no problem on sending it to a long list because they have like. I also tried it for other client. It's no problem. It's just that the logs like the logs is updating.

Bryan Wolf   59:30
Enter.
And it worked.
It's just a lot of, yeah, in here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   59:40
The like, yeah, like a delay, but it's actually sending sending the emails successfully. Oh right. The other thing also is I think, yeah, we would need to change the account to your.

Bryan Wolf   59:47
OK, good.

Lem Quimpo   59:57
Not the Serrala one, because if we use the Serrala one, we would need to have a permission. Yeah, that's right, we would need a permission for like the website to connect.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:02
It's like got a firewall or whatever. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, I wonder if that's this is where we need Peter 'cause I don't 'cause I think he strictly wants it being sent to not personal emails, but we'll say I don't really know.

Lem Quimpo   1:00:17
Oh, OK, Yep, Yep. So yeah, I just want to note that also.
Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:25
'Cause I think it changes the formatting, right? Or we've we've figured that out actually.

Lem Quimpo   1:00:30
The formatting of um.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:34
Or Soral's emails.

Lem Quimpo   1:00:37
For.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:39
Mm-hmm. Couldn't it change the formatting when you sent externally to throughout throughout based emails in Outlook? It would change the format.

Lem Quimpo   1:00:49
If we forward it to other person, yeah, I think it it change. Yeah, it changes the format when we forward. For example, I would forward this to like another. Yeah, yeah, when we, yeah, that's right when we forward it so.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:00
Oh, right, right, right, right, right, right. That's why, 'cause moving forwarded, it would change the content. That's right. No, just all basic setting, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:01:08
Like the e-mail is not like reading the HTML form HTML format correctly, but if we send it as a newsletter so it's actually fine. What I was concerned about was the.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:13
Structured, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:01:24
If you use like the at serala.com, uh seral.com.
Yeah, Sarala e-mail. So we would have like a problem there if it it doesn't have like a like the permission on the like your website or something because that's already like a company e-mail, right? So we would also need like a permission for like the company side.
But if you're just using like the@gmail.com like the personal one, I think uh it's it's not a problem.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:54
OK, awesome. I think we're just gonna wait for Peter at this point. I messaged him twice, so hopefully he comes back in here.

Lem Quimpo   1:01:57
Yep.
Yep.
Yep. Uh.
Let me just all surrender.
Yeah, so I I also already so the output there was also factoring out the yeah, I just want to note also factoring out the the persona of like Peter this like long persona.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:35
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:02:35
So yeah, I'm not really sure also if.
Like.
Yeah, basically I think it has also like an like a big like an impact there on the content like the output.
But yeah, I'm already adding it on the.
Claude's, uh, content creation.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:04
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:03:07
And.
So let me try it also. Uh, let's try the surround. Let's say surround.
Services resource.
So for example this one.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:36
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:03:48
Oh.
Then.
66.
So I'm testing out the.
Automation for the blog post.
Yeah.
Alright.
Uh.
Change the.
Conference.
This is fine.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:12
Oh.

Lem Quimpo   1:06:20
Your request too large.
Yeah. I think, uh, the target market audience would be much better here.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:38
Uh.

Lem Quimpo   1:06:41
So it can process if it's, uh, very long.
Uh, very long output.
Uh, input, I mean.
So let me just change it and remove first the persona.
Coming your fence.
Get Insights processor.
Are.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:11
Mm.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:13
So we're doing our pressures.
Yeah, I'm not sure if it's ready.
Uh.
So let's test it out for other ones. Uh, let me go back here.
Mm.

Bartosz Borek   1:10:48
So Lem, when you paste the newsletter stuff in here, do you have to fill out everything or do you just have to put in the blog citation URL?

Lem Quimpo   1:10:55
The.
Yeah the the just the link and then it would automatically search for that link and then create the blog content. I I I'm just checking if like the output is like.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:06
All right.

Bartosz Borek   1:11:07
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:11:14
Like it's actually getting here. So yeah, I think you would have like an insight also because you're more familiar with the particular article if it's actually like getting. But basically this is just like an overview and doesn't have like a relevance angle or something.

Bartosz Borek   1:11:31
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:11:32
So for example this one, so the in house bank or notional pool cash management. So like this is the overview for it. So I'm not sure if like it's really.
Uh.

Bartosz Borek   1:11:45
No, that's good. That's fine. That's That's pulling in good stuff.

Lem Quimpo   1:11:47
Yeah, I think the this one like the cache pulling in just on SD loader.
Hi, that's my solution. Global patient we have.
Yeah, I'm not sure what this pobo is what all about.
So it's.

Bartosz Borek   1:12:08
Yeah, that's that's fine. That's paying on behalf of. So that's OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:12:12
Oh, OK.
Um, yes.
And then for the upcoming events, yes, I'm just testing this out also.
If it would be a, it would get the.
Yeah. So you, it actually has like introduction here. So I think, yeah, that would be good.
OK.
Let's trigger the.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:57
Oh.

Lem Quimpo   1:12:58
So.
Joins around put 16 during the CRF August 1820 discover cutting edge accounts receivable solution designed to accelerate cash flow edge. Yep, is that? Yeah, I think it's. Yeah, it's.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:46
Very simple.

Lem Quimpo   1:13:50
Yep, and also try for the other.
Uh.
Other events? Yeah, I'm not sure if because this is German, but yeah, I'm also curious if it can.
Like get that.
Yeah, so this is German.
So uh, try that one.
So for this one, yeah.
Uh.
Then uh, coming events.
Yeah so I'm I'm just manually like triggering it but on when the all automation is on and we have the like the app script this would like automatically process the link when we have the check when we put the check mark here.
Yes, it's actually the German one is the content is also in German. So I think, yeah, that's because.
But for this one, September 10.
Yeah, basically this the summary is different here. Experience demos get expert inside participate in our scratch and win game transfer win prizes.
That's odd.
Scratching in game. Not sure where did it get that one.
Yeah, it's actually hallucinating. As you can see here, I think perplexity would be much better.
A solution for this one.
Uh, let me just, uh, change this.
Oh.
Overview.
Oh.
Yeah, uh, yeah, perplexity is really much better.
Stop by their booth for live demos, expert insights and search yourself finance leaders.
Yep, that's good.
Uh, let's check out the other one.
Um.
CRF.
Connect with 16 during this year.
Uh, CRF.
Where's the Austin here? Stay.
I'm not sure if this is.
Yes.
Um.
Bart, are you still there? Just need to ask some question. Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   1:23:43
Hey, yes, yeah, sure. I'm uh, I'm working on the list of logs that we can use.

Lem Quimpo   1:23:48
Uh.
OK, yeah, I I'm just want to ask if like the event for.
Whatever. Yeah, this one is in Austin, this one.
Or because it's it's actually not here.

Bartosz Borek   1:24:05
Uh.
E.
Where is it? I I don't know. Sorry, I don't know where this is. I don't usually go to our events, so there's no there's no OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:24:13
Oh, right.
OK, yeah, so but.
Yeah, I've actually fed it to.
Yeah, perplexity it it I was just maybe it's hallucinating or some something. So just want to confirm if it's actually, yeah. So as you can see it's it actually picked up like the booth 16 at CRF. Just not sure if it's like in Austin if it's.
Because it.

Bartosz Borek   1:24:43
Does it say Austin anywhere on the website?

Lem Quimpo   1:24:45
Yeah, so it it actually didn't. It did. It doesn't. Yeah, it doesn't have. It doesn't have Austin here.

Bartosz Borek   1:24:50
You do control F and then type in Austin.
See, that's a problem. It's a problem.

Lem Quimpo   1:24:56
Yeah, but the thing with perplexity is it it's actually also searching like just not the link, but also like the Internet. But yeah, for more context, yeah, but that would actually be a problem if.
Oh.
Yes, so I was searching also if this is like the correct.
Uh.
Yeah, maybe it's really hallucinating.
August forum in Expo August 18.
Yeah, it's different one.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:46
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   1:25:48
Yeah, we we have the, we have the ask Peter, 'cause I have no idea where that is.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:50
Oh, it it it's, yes, I think it's actually.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:53
And a couple.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:56
Yeah, this one.

Bartosz Borek   1:26:01
The Credit Research Foundation. Uh, that's not. Oh, was that it?

Bryan Wolf   1:26:05
I don't love it. I don't. Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:26:05
Yeah, this one, August 1820, so.

Bartosz Borek   1:26:07
The August foreman. Oh, wow. So it's right. OK, wow. Look at that. Amazing.

Lem Quimpo   1:26:11
This one, Yeah, it's yeah, because perplexity is also like searching the web for like more context. But yeah, it actually like the information was right because like the booth 16, right, it was able to get this one.
So this is very specific for here. So it's not actually hallucinating, it's just cross referencing. I think the like the like the Expo from yeah this one so but I I'm not sure also maybe this is like yeah this is just the same date right for the.
Uh, but yeah, basically this is like talking about credit. Um.
Maybe finance something? I'm not sure also.
Uh yeah.
But.
Most of your not sure if your events has like um.
Already has. Uh, yeah, there's no.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:24
The long drilling.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:26
There's no location, so maybe I could just add the guard drill for the.

Bartosz Borek   1:27:31
So.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:35
Mm.
Script system.
Yeah.
Yes, it's actually hallucinating now. It's in London.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:47
London now.

Lem Quimpo   1:28:48
Yeah, so rather just from Gardner's Executive Conference.
Where do I save?

Bartosz Borek   1:28:55
This is in London though, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:28:59
All right, yeah, I actually added a different link.

Bryan Wolf   1:29:00
Yeah, it is. Yeah. Good eye, Bart. Yeah, good eye.

Bartosz Borek   1:29:03
So.
Yeah, yeah, that's we see we we tend to have events like in Europe. So if it's in Austin, I'm like, oh, I I'm not sure, but OK, yeah, this one makes sense.

Lem Quimpo   1:29:05
I thought it was.
Yeah, I actually, yeah, I I inputted the link. So I thought that it was like the CRF. So yeah, this is like the Gartner. So this was the CRF too. I I was thinking I inputted this one.
Yeah, let me just check the other one.
The CRF 1.
Oops.
Uh.
So we should do this one.
Yeah, that's fine.
Oh, shoot.
Yeah, basically, actually, I'll put in the same the Austin one, not sure why.
The next session was 19. How modern customer report has accelerated payments.
No seconds.
Yeah, August 19.
Just not sure if it's in Austin.
Oh, modern customer portal. Yeah, that's right.
So a few minutes from here and borrowing your guys's best friends from birthday.
But yeah.
Oh, let's process one more. Um.
This one.
Sure.
350 plus, Yeah, that's good. 350 plus decision makers, key users. Yeah, it's actually good. It's picking up the right one.
Hide strategies, insights and tools.
Predictive finance.
We should put events.
Finance automation in action. Yeah, that's right.
So let's say it has to predict the finance and informations.

Bartosz Borek   1:33:21
All right, so in this chat I just sent 17 links.

Lem Quimpo   1:33:23
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:28
Oh, OK.

Bartosz Borek   1:33:28
Uh, which we should be able to load and should.

Lem Quimpo   1:33:36
OK.

Bartosz Borek   1:33:36
Should be able to go into that spreadsheet for that one section of Anna Sarala Insights.
Yeah, I split them up, so hopefully they're easily easily to paste in there, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:33:47
Yeah, this one.
Um.
Uh, yeah, I'll try to.

Bartosz Borek   1:33:57
Hopefully see if that works.

Lem Quimpo   1:34:00
Put it on.
here.
Yeah, I think that's much better.
Just take out the other one so that uh.
OK.
Oops.
Oops.
OK.
Yes, and let me just update the.
This is the baby insights, right?
I think perplexity is.
Much better in handling this.
A search one.
Uh, Bank of New York.
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   1:37:42
Brian, sorry, I'm kind of like multitasking, so I'm all over the place. But what else do we? What else do we need for this? What else do we need here for?

Bryan Wolf   1:37:46
There you go.
And that's really a part. So you sent me, so I'm gonna work on the Um.

Bartosz Borek   1:37:54
Persona, right? You're gonna kind of enhance the persona a bit and then do.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:56
Alright.
The I'm gonna add more to the more Peter's things to the RSS feed, right? To get better content. Lem is structuring, you know, really everything himself. And then this stuff right here that you sent, this is, I mean.

Bartosz Borek   1:38:03
The prompt, right? OK, right. OK, right.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:17
This is Lem too. I like what Lem's doing. I'm like always a day behind Lem and I've been watching him now, so mimicking a lot of the stuff he's doing on my make. So it's kind of up to speed. But I mean, I, you know, I'm not much else I can do.

Bartosz Borek   1:38:23
OK.
OK.
OK. All right. So I don't think, I think that's all you guys need from me for now, right? OK. All right. So are we going to start running prototypes like starting tomorrow to get to kind of like fake newsletters? So then I guess on Friday we can send.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:38
We're good, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:38:44
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:52
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   1:38:52
The real thing or is that the plan?

Lem Quimpo   1:38:53
Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:53
Yeah, so I just have mine off. Like I I keep mine off. But I mean, I'd have to add, if you wanted one, I'd add your e-mail in there. But you know, Peter gets one and I get one and we can look at it tomorrow morning. But yeah.

Bartosz Borek   1:38:56
OK, alright.
OK.
OK, yeah, perfect. After all of these changes are in though, right? OK, so Lem, I don't know what we're. I don't really know what to what the path forward should be for the Sarala events.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:08
Uh, yes, definitely. Yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:39:12
Yep, that's right.

Bartosz Borek   1:39:21
Um.

Lem Quimpo   1:39:21
OK.

Bartosz Borek   1:39:23
I I think we'll just need kind of Peter to opine on what's required there.
I would imagine just the most recent or the the upcoming one is the one we should be kind of like promoting. But yeah, I don't know, maybe he has a different idea, so.

Lem Quimpo   1:39:32
Yeah.
Yeah, but but for the articles it was. What do you think about the like the overview of the articles? Is it already good or we need to like for example this one so.

Bartosz Borek   1:39:55
And so offers turn around.

Lem Quimpo   1:39:59
Because on my prompt I'm just adding like a summary overview so just over here so sample this one.

Bartosz Borek   1:40:03
Yeah. Hey, listen, so this is good. It should just provide an overview because obviously it just should say what it is because if someone like for instance.

Lem Quimpo   1:40:10
Yep.

Bartosz Borek   1:40:16
We realize not everyone's going to click on these articles. There's literally no one out there that's going to be and be like, oh, I wonder what this is. Oh, I wonder what this is. I wonder what this is. So we're trying to just kind of give summaries that if a client is potentially or a potential customer.

Lem Quimpo   1:40:16
A .
Yep.

Bartosz Borek   1:40:32
Is going or wants to know a little something about FX or about in-house cash, or maybe they know estate lover and they're curious what other competitors use. Then they'll click. So a little description like this is very good because.

Lem Quimpo   1:40:43
OK.

Bartosz Borek   1:40:48
You know, it might entice someone to click on that link and learn more so.

Lem Quimpo   1:40:54
OK, OK, it's good.

Bartosz Borek   1:40:55
That's kind of the goal, right? So.

Lem Quimpo   1:40:57
Yep. OK. Yeah. So I think, yeah, that that this is working good. And then for the upcoming events, yeah, we're not, but yeah, the the automation, I'm just not sure also if.

Bartosz Borek   1:41:00
OK, cool.

Lem Quimpo   1:41:13
Yeah, we need some inputs from Peter also, but OK, I I think we could. Tomorrow we could.

Bartosz Borek   1:41:13
Yeah.
Yeah, Bryan, are you gonna? OK, cool. Bryan, are you gonna talk to Peter about this or before our call tomorrow or?

Bryan Wolf   1:41:22
Yeah, listen, I I I've gotten constant in twice. I'm gonna see him later today, I think. So I'll definitely get in touch with him. We'll go over definitely by the end of the day.

Bartosz Borek   1:41:27
OK, perfect. All right. Awesome. Yeah, just.
All right, perfect. OK, cool.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:35
All right, I'll go see you tomorrow.

Bartosz Borek   1:41:37
All right. I'll talk to you guys tomorrow. Thanks a lot. Thanks, Bryan. Everyone else. Thanks, guys. Bye. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:39
Bye guys. I'm see you, Bart, see you, Pete, Nick.

Lem Quimpo   1:41:43
Okay, Bart. See ya.

Bartosz Borek   1:41:45
Have a good one, guys.
