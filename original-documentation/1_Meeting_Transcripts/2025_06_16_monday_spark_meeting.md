Nicholas Westburg started transcription

Bryan Wolf   0:03
I put the prompt in there and that's it, right?

Lem   0:07
Yeah, I think.
It would be better if you put the like the prompt first the text prompt at the top.

Bryan Wolf   0:17
Here.

Lem   0:18
You can actually like drag this one.
Yeah, yeah, that one.
I think you can drag this one.
As you can see on the content one.

Bryan Wolf   0:27
Well, she. What do you mean though?
'Cause this says it's just it's just.
It's just a drop down menu instead of like I can put the actual text in there.

Lem   0:37
Yeah, this is like the text prompt.

Bryan Wolf   0:41
Yeah.

Lem   0:41
And.

Nicholas Westburg   0:41
I'm late so I'm late. So Brian, sorry to interrupt you guys.

Bryan Wolf   0:44
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   0:46
Where are you?
Where are you hitting a roadblock?
Just so I can.

Bryan Wolf   0:51
Basically I'm just so right now this.
AI ChatGPT creates the prompt, creates the the LinkedIn posting prompt and I'm trying to unlink this.
And link it to this to Claude and then just skip. But I think also that this.
When I try to, I don't know if you wanna walk me through what I'm doing wrong and and what I gotta do, right.
It'd be great. I'll stop sharing.

Lem   1:25
Yeah. Yeah, basically, I think you would need to map it on the.
The following modules after that one, maybe that's why it's airing out or not sure because the out.

Bryan Wolf   1:39
Now here let me. OK. So let me show you. What if what says so let's just see.

Lem   1:44
Does it?

Bryan Wolf   1:46
Yeah.
Yeah.
Can I just do it like this?
Or no.

Lem   1:58
Yeah, you can unlink this one to the Google Doc. The get persona and then Yep, you can actually for test this out.
Yeah, yeah, it's it would error out because we were like feeding the get persona.

Bryan Wolf   2:17
Yeah. So.

Lem   2:18
So I think you can like unlink this.
Google Sheet to the get persona and then you can start the.

Bryan Wolf   2:29
This one.

Lem   2:30
Yeah, you can unlink that one and then connect it to anthropic.
Nope, that get persona.
No, no, no. Just, yeah, that one you could connect that to Claud the get persona and then.
Just yeah, you can put it there. Yeah. OK.
I just.
I just.
That's it for now. Yeah, those two pair.
Those two those two modules.
Just you can click the run once.
Just click the run once so that it would.
Yeah.
Go send the documents not accessible.
It's not.
Access. Can you go back to the?
Yeah, I think we have a problem on the cloud basically.
Yeah, it's not getting, oh, this is apdf.
Yeah, I think we should first.

Bryan Wolf   3:29
Yeah, that's what should I do? Should like. Where is it? Where is it?

Lem   3:36
Yeah, PDF document.
Yeah, I think that's why it's not.

Bryan Wolf   3:42
There was a couple more options last time.
I don't know where here we go.
Text.

Lem   3:51
It should be the.
So it if it is a.

Bryan Wolf   3:55
So I remember you said there's a there's a glitch like for.
Roll or something.

Lem   4:04
Hug.

Bryan Wolf   4:05
That's what you were saying.
Never mind.
Just just tell me what I gotta do.

Lem   4:09
Yeah. For this one, I think we could.
Convert first the like the document to apdf, but basically could actually feed your persona here on like as a text.

Bryan Wolf   4:24
Yeah, like in here.

Lem   4:27
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we could.

Bryan Wolf   4:28
But remember, it's really long.
It's really long.
It's really big.
Remember, we were saying that it gets it gets confused and so big.

Lem   4:32
Yeah, it's that, that's just.
Yeah, that's the.
Let me just.
Umm.
And just save this one.
Yeah, I think we have a problem here on the.
It can parse. I think the document because it should be apdf.
Let me just open my.
My make account.
And just test it out.

Bryan Wolf   5:24
Sure, this makes a lot of sense.

Lem   5:26
Number oh, that's number two.

Bryan Wolf   5:29
Oh wow, I want to be able to put these in a folder or.

Lem   5:37
Uh.
Yeah, that's that's. Yeah, that's very long, right.

Bryan Wolf   5:46
Yeah.

Lem   5:46
It should be, yeah.
It's much better if.
Can let me just test it out for me.
OK, let's say.
Hmm.
Which is file.
I need to.

Bryan Wolf   6:32
This was also a thing.
You know it says referenced model like on Friday when I try to do this myself.
This specific error keep coming up keeps referencing AI, so I think in earlier on these were just like having it set up to do that instead of quote.

Lem   6:49
Yeah, yeah, because actually the create document for blog post is has and if you.
It actually has the result from ChatGPT.
So if we you would use cloud, you would remap it the result to cloud.
But yeah, let me just.
Tested out also on my.
Yeah.
Wrenches.
It here.
OK.
Hmm.
It's not appearing.
Document ID OK.
Uh.
Document.
Document ID.
This one.
Then I'll test this out.
User.
Text.
Then.

Bryan Wolf   8:56
Hmm.

Lem   9:01
Work. Sauna. All right, just a persona.
This song is.
Fine, yeah.
OK.
Google Docs standard documents currently avail.
Able see.
Yep, I think it can parse it out correctly.
Wow.
Yeah, it I think it should be.
Apdf document.
We would need to.
Yeah, I can parse it out correctly.

Bryan Wolf   10:29
Yes, I just trying to put in the text like what you're saying.

Lem   10:41
Type document.
Yeah, can actually get it.
Let me try if there's a PDF here.
MMM.
Download.
You always PDF.
OK.
Then.
Upload.
And.
Get the file, wanna transfer it?
Down in the fire, OK.

Bryan Wolf   12:04
Lim I'm wondering.

Lem   12:05
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   12:07
So when we go to the CHA Cha BC filtered and pick a document and tell it to add it into my Google Docs. When it when it puts it in here.
Is there any way that we could set it up so that whatever is getting put in here gets put into like a separate folder so that this isn't just like full?

Lem   12:28
Yeah, yeah. Actually the one that I originally set up was we're basically, yeah, we were putting the drafts on a particular Google Drive folder. And then the completed to another. But we had a problem, right.

Bryan Wolf   12:34
Was like that.
Right.

Lem   12:44
Because there's like like an error on your.

Bryan Wolf   12:45
My Google Drive wasn't working or something like yeah, but I think that we fixed it right.

Lem   12:47
Yeah, yeah, but now it's ready.
Yeah, it's already OK.
So I think yeah, we can put it, you can just.
Build like, create a new folder for like for the drafts and then.
I think it's in the first first.
System on the content first one.
And then.
Give me just a second. Get the.
PDF.
Just change the name of this.
OK.
The drive download.

Bryan Wolf   13:47
I do.
I do have a.

Lem   13:50
So for the list.
PDF.
Yeah.
OK.
Then.
Let's see.
Yep, I think it's now good.

Bryan Wolf   14:14
All right, you want to share your screen or you want to just tell them what to do? What do you want to do?

Lem   14:15
Should be apdf.
Uh.
Yeah. So I'll just share my screen first.
This one.
Show screen.
OK.
Yeah. So basically what I did is I converted your.

Bryan Wolf   14:41
Mm hmm.

Lem   14:43
I like this one.
This particular persona.

Bryan Wolf   14:45
Mm hmm.

Lem   14:47
So I've actually downloaded it as apdf and then I just added it to the Google Drive as this one PDF Bryan Wolf persona and then now actually we can because it can't parse it correctly so.

Bryan Wolf   14:58
True.

Lem   15:04
Now actually it can now get it.
So I've added instead of the.
Download persona right here.
Get persona Google doc.

Bryan Wolf   15:12
Move.

Lem   15:12
So we just went on a different route, which is the Google Drive download the file.
So this is actually downloading the data from that particular PDF and then it is sending that data here on anthropic log yeah.

Bryan Wolf   15:26
So when I make that first Google Google Drive thing join, you watch all files search for files Download file.

Lem   15:30
Oh yeah.
Download the file so this is the download the file and then you can just replace this instead of this.
Get persona here.

Bryan Wolf   15:41
Hello.

Lem   15:42
You could replace it via this one.
So this is a Google Drive.
Download the file you can.

Bryan Wolf   15:46
OK.
So when I do you wanna just walk me through the steps of the Google? The Google Drive one. See what I'm missing in there? Because enter manually file ID.

Lem   15:52
Yeah.
Yep, OK.
So this one yeah. So select from the list.
Oh, first you you would need to like download your persona as a PDF.

Bryan Wolf   16:04
For sure.

Lem   16:05
Yeah, just open it, open it, and then, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   16:06
OK, OK.
So hold on. Open. Yeah.

Lem   16:11
File and then download.

Bryan Wolf   16:13
Download download PDF document OK, I did that and just save it.

Lem   16:14
Now that's PDF. Yeah, OK.
And then, yeah, so it already went to your computer PC on your file. Then just go back to your.

Bryan Wolf   16:23
Yeah.
Oh.

Lem   16:26
Or Google Drive on my drive and then upload that particular PDF here so that we could access it.

Bryan Wolf   16:27
Yeah.
Oh.
Upload aware in a select folder like the LinkedIn draft test test, LinkedIn drafter or just anywhere.

Lem   16:40
Yeah, just just anywhere here on your on drive, but yeah in the.

Bryan Wolf   16:43
So when you say upload, I already have it in here but it's it's say it is a word, so you're saying.

Lem   16:48
Yeah, you could just.
Oh, do you have the PDF there?

Bryan Wolf   16:53
Yeah, here.
Can I share?

Lem   16:55
OK, sure.
If you have the PDF, you could you could actually just.

Bryan Wolf   17:00
So I don't think it's apdf, but I just say it is apdf.
But this is what I got here.
Are you?
Can you see my screen?

Lem   17:08
Yeah. Yeah, that Beowulf.

Bryan Wolf   17:10
Yeah, yeah.
BJ Oh no.
So I just did a solo look, so I'll do it again, studio.

Lem   17:13
Oh, this isn't.
Download.
OK.
Yeah. So yeah, I think this is the one.

Bryan Wolf   17:26
Well, it says as a word docs though or yeah.

Lem   17:29
No, this is actually the PDF file. As you can see on the type it's yeah, that one. You can actually just yeah, you can just because this is already on your downloads, you can just upload this one on your Google Drive.

Bryan Wolf   17:32
Right here.
What's up?
Yeah. So I just.

Lem   17:43
So can you go back to your?
Yeah, this one.
My drive and then just click the new and then just file upload.
Then just upload that particular PDF.
On your downloads? Yeah, that one.
So now we would be accessing that one that one.
So this is the like the PDF one so.

Bryan Wolf   18:01
OK.

Lem   18:05
Like OK and then?
Now we can actually.
Yeah.
Nope, this is that docs, so this is a different one.
So can you find the other one?
Itshouldbe.pdf.
Maybe we can rename this one to an PDF?

Bryan Wolf   18:32
Yeah.

Lem   18:33
Yeah, because it's you have multiple the same names here.
Just put.
The.
Yes, OK.
And then.
Yeah, my drive.
Then.

Bryan Wolf   19:05
Oh ****, I don't even know what.

Lem   19:07
It's.
You can actually. I can search it also here on the there's a search.

Bryan Wolf   19:11
OK.

Lem   19:17
Search bar here on.

Bryan Wolf   19:18
OK.
Let me just let me just rename it better.

Lem   19:24
Yeah, you can put the PDF on the. Yeah, this one. I think this would be much better.
Dangerous.

Bryan Wolf   19:38
I have to give it a minute.

Lem   19:42
Yeah, we can actually just create a new module.
You can actually create a new node, so sometimes it's.

Bryan Wolf   19:49
Download or search.

Lem   19:51
Getting yeah, the download download one because we need to.
Download the data coming from it.
Then yeah, that one PDF and then save.
So yeah, it should be the I link it and it should be before the anthropical.
Yeah, that one before the anthropic log.
And then now you can just.
Put the clock there and then go to anthropic clod and we would remap this one.
Oh, no, no.
Just link it first it's actually.

Bryan Wolf   20:28
I'm looking from here or.

Lem   20:29
Yeah, I'll I'll link it then.
Just put the can you put the clock or the trigger?

Bryan Wolf   20:33
I can put it on Claude, but not on here.

Lem   20:35
No on Google Drive.
Can can you put on?

Bryan Wolf   20:38
See that it won't work though. I don't know why.

Lem   20:42
Oh, I think this is.
Yeah, it's. I think it's glitching now.
I just can you see it?
Yeah, just save it first.

Bryan Wolf   21:06
Hello, arcan.

Lem   21:09
Still can't, huh?
Oh, why is it like that?
I just fixed first. Can you open the cloud then Tropic cloud?
Oh, it's not connect voice.
It's not connected.
Oh.
OK. Just.
Oh, I see. I see.

Bryan Wolf   21:35
Oh ****.

Lem   21:37
Yeah, just OK, delete it first.
OK.
Connect it there. Yeah. OK. I think that would already.
No, no, just don't connect it.
For now, we would need to test it first.

Bryan Wolf   21:52
Here we go. I got it.

Lem   21:53
Yep, OK.
Then map it. Yeah, this one.
And then yeah, click that one.
The Google Drive Download file.
So this would actually get the file.
And then yeah, I think.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   22:09
Michael jou.

Lem   22:12
No, that's already OK. The Google Drive one the file.
Yeah, that one.
And then at the top it should be the prompt first so the text prompt.
So you have here the PDF, right?

Bryan Wolf   22:24
Where?
We're here.

Lem   22:28
No, this is actually the content too.
So it's like the another part of the prompt.

Bryan Wolf   22:31
OK.

Lem   22:33
So this already OK the the first one. As you can see the user then content one, so this should be a text and then we would need to put the prompt here.
Yeah, that one. Then on the text.
So it should be the like the prompt from.

Bryan Wolf   22:46
****, I don't see the problem.
I didn't get the prompt from from ChatGPT right here.
Announce is this a? No, it isn't tomorrow.

Lem   23:00
Yeah. Did you just copy, copy and paste this one?

Bryan Wolf   23:11
OK.

Lem   23:13
And then.
Below that, can you click the file?
It's it should be just the Google Drive Download file.
Yeah, that one.
So yeah, below this one, we need to input also like the summary or because the one that is coming from Google Sheets.
So because it wouldn't have contacts on the article, it can't make the article without the particular content so.

Bryan Wolf   23:39
OK.

Lem   23:41
Yeah. Can you save it first and then yeah, we would need to get the another prompt from.
ChatGPT so.
The next the next user prompt there.
Yeah, that's one so.
OK.
Then.
We can put a text and then just yeah, just put input.
Yeah, the persona you can actually just remove the persona and then just link in posting angle summary of articles here citation website yeah and then.
Yeah, for testing, I think we could so that we could get the data, some data we could link this one to the Google sheet.
Now the every 8:00 AM checks.
Yeah, this this one.
Nope, it should be the first one.
Yeah, I'll link it first to the. Yeah, this one.
And link and then yeah the trigger should be there.
Yeah. And then if you could go to.
The spreadsheet so.
Then we're ready.
Just remove one status here which is done.
Yeah, just one.
So that it can process that particular summary OK.
Then yeah, we could test it out run once.
Um, so can you see value in parameter PDF file name?
Yeah. So it's airing out.
Can we check the?
That's odd, yeah.
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   25:48
To refresh it.

Lem   25:50
Can you save and go back?
Can you check the output for the Google Drive this one?
The output for it.
Can just click the cancel and then I then just yeah, this one.
Oh yeah, it actually got.
The.
Yeah, I actually got it.
So can you go back to the error? Let's.
Station in parameter PDF file if you.
File name extension.
All right, that's odd.
Just check my.
Should be PDF and then Download file yeah.
Hmm.
Yep, that's OK then.
Yeah. Can you?
Yeah, can run it again.
Try to run it again.
Run once.
One parameter.

Bryan Wolf   27:17
This is the same thing I was getting last time.

Lem   27:19
So invalid file name extension in parameter PDF.
Phone.
Umm, let me just check my so this is like the yeah the user.
Text. Can you go back to Claude?
And then I think we should.
Yeah, it should be the 'cause.
It's the user text OK.
Can you go down?
Type the PDF then.
Yeah, it should.
I think it it should be the last.
Can you?
Let's try to like, can you remove this content tree?
Just X the yeah, you can, actually. Yeah. And then we we try it, if it it could parse it out correctly.
So just run once.
Oh, so it's it's really.
It really can't get the file that's odd.
Can you open it again? Maybe the.
Console.
Oh, I'm using SONET 4.
Maybe they think.
Can you?
Yeah, let's try to change the model and then.
Can you go down on the something wrong on the PDF?
Yeah, it should be fine.
Then the Google Drive is OK.
Can we try it again? Can you click save?
So I don't find extension.
Can you go to the Google Drive?
I think we why is it?
Yeah, the note, Google Drive node and then.

Bryan Wolf   29:22
Just make just redeem. Do it again.

Lem   29:32
Think.
Ah, the risk card available.
Why is it working here?
Let me just.
That's this one.

Bryan Wolf   29:48
Oh.

Lem   29:49
Input.
Then.
Let me just uh.
Think it can parse it correctly.

Bryan Wolf   30:15
Yeah.

Lem   30:17
Hmm.
Content.
Yeah, it's actually working on my side. Why is it?

Bryan Wolf   30:52
I know, I think it just 'cause remember you said it gets gets to glitching sometimes. So I think it's just.

Lem   30:58
Uh, Google Drive?
Maybe we can.
Yeah. Can you go back to Claude, let's just.
Delete the other the content the second content.
Then let's create another like another.
Yeah, another one.
So just add content.
Maybe it's like glitching.
Yeah, PDF document then.
Yeah, that this one, OK.
Click save and then Yep.
Value must not be empty.
Oh well, what's that?
Yeah, I think it's it's glitching.
Reaching out.

Bryan Wolf   31:44
There we go.

Lem   31:45
Yeah, it's already. OK. OK.
Can you try it once? Run once?
Hmm.
For some reason it can't get the PDF file.
Yeah, I think it's already.

Bryan Wolf   32:12
So I go.
I don't think I'm too.

Lem   32:18
PDF file.
Yeah. So have you have you?
Can you?
Can we like first Test it out without the PDF maybe?
It's like.
A.

Bryan Wolf   32:42
We just put just put the person in here.

Lem   32:43
Yeah, just just the like this prompt. Yeah, just a text.

Bryan Wolf   32:46
Just put the persona in here so you know, OK.

Lem   32:49
I know just let's just test it out first.
Yep. And then just remove the PDF, OK and then save.
Then let's just. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. Run it once.
And if yeah, I think it's, yeah, it's working fine without the PDF.

Bryan Wolf   33:05
Yeah.

Lem   33:12
Prod Sonic 4.
Rule 4.
Rule 1 user.
Text content two type PDF.
Down the file.
Yes, it's download the file also.
Huh.
Yeah, I'm not sure why this is not.
Can we create a new?
Maybe we can create a new like a Google Drive note.
Sure, it's not parsing out correctly.
It's actually working on my side.
Yes, select from the list and then.
The PDF one.
Umm.
OK.
Then.
Let's.
Oh, I see, I think wait.
But Nope actually.
Did they share this one?
Oh, sure.
06 actually restricted, so they did.
Yeah. Can you go back to the?
Claude, does it have the PDFI?
Think we did.
We remove it, right?
Yeah, we remove the PDF.
So I think we could check it again if.
Oh, can you go back to that particular cloud and cloud prompt cloud and then cloud node, then just go back to the PDF and check if the map.
If it's map correctly, yeah, it's actually map correctly.
It's 22. Yeah, Google Drive.
Gen.
OK, can you click?
Yeah. Can we try it?
Click save.
Yeah, it's still error.
Not sure why I think this because.
Mine is actually.
Name.pdf.
Yeah, maybe there's. Can you rename it and just add that that PDF? Maybe there's a.
On the Google Drive, yeah.
Maybe there's?

Bryan Wolf   36:06
How do you want me to name it?

Lem   36:08
Yeah, just add on thelast.pdf on the last. Yeah that that one.
Just.
Without the space.
Yeah, just without this, OK.
Let's try it out if.
Maybe can parse it right? Because it's.
Then go back to the Google Drive and then let's just.
Map it again.
Yep, this one then save.
Then run once.
Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah, there's some, like. So this is how we how I debug things.

Bryan Wolf   36:58
Oh, there we go. There we go.

Lem   37:05
It's like a trial and error and just finding out the way because sometimes like like the like this one in Entropy's case, there's like particular naming conventions that they want.
So it's not parsing it out right.

Bryan Wolf   37:18
Yeah.

Lem   37:20
Yeah. So yeah, it's just like.
Test, testing, trial and error and then just some patience, yeah.
And yeah, I think this should.
But I think we we didn't put an input here on the yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   37:35
We didn't.
Yeah. So it's not going to show up in the in the Google Sheets.
That's OK though.

Lem   37:38
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   37:39
We can just read it from my radio here.

Lem   37:41
Yeah, I yeah, I think it won't because there's no input for like the summary, the article and stuff.
So we should actually add the input here on the.
Yeah, after the text, as you can see after that one.
After the rules, you can actually add.
The the one on ChatGPT.
The one with the input. So as you can see on the excuse me on the.
Yep, this one.
So without the persona.
So Lincoln. Yeah, this one, OK.
And then.

Bryan Wolf   38:18
Right now.

Lem   38:19
Yeah, just add it after the rules.
Enter OK and and another one.
Yeah, this one and then.
At the top I think.
At the can you go to the prompt at the top of the prompt if we've added?
The.
I will also provide my persona in the input to help out. OK, so it's already also there.
Can you just put?
I will also provide my persona in the PDF file so that it it would also have a context on the.
Because.

Bryan Wolf   39:00
Here or or get rid of this.

Lem   39:02
It just on the. Yeah, that one on that particular paragraph, so.

Bryan Wolf   39:07
So you want. OK, OK, OK.

Lem   39:09
Yeah, just add.
I will also provide my persona in PDF form in PDF file.

Bryan Wolf   39:15
You want me to?
You want me to get? You want me to get rid of?

Lem   39:15
Yeah, yeah, just add it.

Bryan Wolf   39:17
Get rid of this or that. OK. OK, I'll also provide.

Lem   39:19
Yeah, just just add it, right.
PDF file.

Bryan Wolf   39:30
Try to do a PDF.

Lem   39:31
Yeah, that that PDF file.
OK and.
Yep.
I think that's good.
And then this one, we can actually, yeah. Now test the the output.

Bryan Wolf   39:46
Sh.

Lem   39:46
Just don't don't connect it first so that we could see that. Yeah, and just run it so that we could see the result for the clock.

Bryan Wolf   39:49
Just rub it.

Lem   40:25
OK. Can you check the?
Yeah, we can now check the.

Bryan Wolf   40:28
Tomorrow.

Lem   40:30
Like the content.
Then.
Yeah, that it's in the array.
I just click the plus button here on the content on the output below, just below that one.
Yeah, that one.
Then also another one. Thanks.
Oh, it's still having that, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   40:49
I see it still has these things on it.

Lem   40:54
That's an issue, but this is actually already on like the Unicode bold.
The only problem here is just that weird.

Bryan Wolf   41:01
Yeah.
It starts.

Lem   41:04
Yeah, weird asterisk.

Bryan Wolf   41:06
Let's see, I think I.

Lem   41:07
Yeah, that's the.
So we are actually ready.
With any in.
The.
Final.
OK.
You can.

Bryan Wolf   41:34
I'm pressuring.
Him.

Lem   41:38
No.

Bryan Wolf   41:39
Yeah.
I know talking about her.

Lem   41:44
In the.
You can.
Yeah. Can you add do not include any in the final output.
Yeah, do not include any star in the final output.
Just a plain text.
Uh, just plain.
Yeah, I think that's the only remaining.
Thing here it's like.

Bryan Wolf   42:15
So if I if I run it again, will it?
Will it show up here again or 'cause? It's a plain text or?

Lem   42:19
Yeah, it it.
Yeah, that's right.
It would show it show, show there again.

Bryan Wolf   42:22
No.
OK.

Lem   42:24
So this is how.

Bryan Wolf   42:24
So but it will, but in in. OK, no, you go. You go. You you go. You go. I don't you go.

Lem   42:27
Pardon, pardon.
Yeah, yeah, this is basically how we could test the prompt so and then adjust it because if we would run it, it would like take time like a few minutes and then we would have another document again, like. So it would like your Google Drive would have lots.

Bryan Wolf   42:43
Mm hmm.

Lem   42:45
Of documents there. So for testing just yeah.

Bryan Wolf   42:47
Yeah, I don't like that.

Lem   42:48
For testing we could. This is how I do it.
Like up until the LLM. And then I'll just check the results if it's already good, then yeah, I can now like connect it to the whole flow.
So basically, yeah, we just can run it once again.
Then check the.
Result again.
So actually we could also add another LLM, because sometimes because the prompt is already very long together with your like Persona, right?

Bryan Wolf   43:22
Mm hmm.
Yeah.

Lem   43:29
So sometimes it gets confused with other rules.
So what we can basically actually do is have another AI model here like like a simple. We can also like use Claude and then it's just for taking out like the weird asterisk and then.
It won't change any of the.

Bryan Wolf   43:46
I see it's still here.

Lem   43:47
Yeah, yeah.
So it's still, yeah, yeah. But basically can actually add another EA like EA model like the, Let's say Entropic.
Yeah, let's say ChatGPT or entropic.
Yeah, you can use entropic plug then.
It's.
Create a prompt. Yeah, this one.
And then just connect it to that one.
Then it the task for this one is just we can actually use the like the cheaper models. So because cloud cloud four and Opus 4 is quite yeah, so just the Cloud Office 3.
Then Max tokens to 1400 and then yeah for the message.
So this is like the role user.
And then yeah, add content Gen. text.
Then yeah, you we could just put here the your task is to remove like weird asterisk or like.
Hyphens, something like that on the text input below.

Bryan Wolf   45:05
On the text below or text below.

Lem   45:07
On the text below.
Yeah, on the text below.
Then you can add don't change any of the.
Don't change any of the content.
Any of the content.
Content then also.
Don't change the Unicode bolding of the titles and the head headers.
Unicode bolding format.
Yeah, Unicode, Bolding, format of the titles and headers.
OK. And then just enter add the?
Yep, the input just enter and then put the input.
Just put the name on the. Yeah. On that one just.
Yeah. Another enter and then put the word input and then colon.
Input, yeah.
Input, then call and then enter.
Then we could actually we could.
Now another enter so that, yeah. And then we could now feed the like the content.
Can you click the content here on the right side? We could map the.
Yeah, from Claude.
Just click the drop down menu.
Nope. Is that that's. Yeah, that one. Text response.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
That's right, yeah.
Text response and then Yep save.
Yeah. So we could actually run it again now.
So basically the task for this one is pretty simple.
Just for this particular, yeah.
So I think it would.
It's really taking its time, huh?

Bryan Wolf   47:31
Mm hmm yeah.

Lem   47:34
Yeah. So let's check the.
Final.
Yeah, but I think I've also, like done some.
Like little research, Claude as of now has like the best for content content creation.
For articles, blogs the the.
My sticking stains really taking St. Timer.
But actually for like for this one for like tasks like simple as this one we could actually use.
Also like ChatGPT, the cheaper ones cause for only parsing and like get taking out the like the weird.

Bryan Wolf   48:21
Mm hmm.

Lem   48:32
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   48:34
Oh man, still got it.

Lem   48:35
Here's the text with the X removed without changing any.
That's weird.

Bryan Wolf   48:42
Oh, so well, so here, let's.

Lem   48:44
Can we actually we.
Can we can like use ChatGPT?
Let's try chat.
ChatGPT.
I think it's creating the.
Yeah.
The create the completion prompt.
Yeah, that one.
Just create a condition, yeah.
Then.
Let's use the.
Yeah, that one. Then the for the model. Let's just use the 4.1 mini system GPT for.
Yeah, this is like a cheaper version of the 4.1 and then.
Add a message.
Just.
You can put it on the system prompt, so just click the system on the role for the role and.
This particular on the yeah on ChatGPT, so the role just change the role to system.

Bryan Wolf   49:37
Where on here or over here to the right or left?
Yeah.

Lem   49:46
The yeah on the above.
That one above the text content so the user.
Yeah, this one developer and developer system.
Yep, yeah, that one for the role, yeah.
And then yeah, we, we would actually add the same like your task is to remove the.
Like asterisk.
From the text.
Yeah, anywhere.
Titles and then.
Don't change any of the. Do not change any of the content.
Content.
Change the Unicode.
Yeah, I didn't change any of the any code content.
And then enter again and then put the input the word input.
And then the text response.
Yeah. Then let's try it again.

Bryan Wolf   51:28
ING.

Lem   51:50
Oh, it's yeah, the ADA Cruz.

Bryan Wolf   51:50
So I got to add more credits.
Hey, Nick, are you still in the line, Nick?
I gotta add more open AI credits.

Lem   52:01
OK.
Yeah, but actually we, yeah, we could.

Nicholas Westburg   52:02
Hold on. What did you say, Ryan?

Bryan Wolf   52:04
Nick, we gotta have more open AI credits to the ChatGPT.

Nicholas Westburg   52:07
I don't think so. Oh, look.
Wait, whatever you getting.
Really.
Let me get a set.

Lem   52:19
Maybe this is a different account because.
You have like several connections there, so I'm not sure if.

Bryan Wolf   52:28
Hold on, nick. Hold on.

Nicholas Westburg   52:29
I look right now.

Lem   52:30
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   52:31
No, I think he's right.
I just gotta put the new API key now that you sent me.
So there's not even. Did you send a GPT 1?

Nicholas Westburg   53:11
Yeah, that's the first one I ever sent you.

Bryan Wolf   53:13
Claude, open ara.

Nicholas Westburg   53:15
No, check it.
I sent it via e-mail.

Bryan Wolf   53:26
What organization ID do I need that?

Lem   53:30
You have a like a default. You can just empty, put it on empty.
If yeah, if it's on a team, not on a team plan.

Bryan Wolf   53:42
Alright, I see.

Lem   53:44
OK.
I think this is good.
And let's try it again.
OK.
I think that's good.
Can we check the result for this?

Bryan Wolf   55:03
Let's go. Yay.

Lem   55:03
Yeah, I think.
Yeah, I think this is much better.
Yep. Then there's a citation.

Bryan Wolf   55:08
OK.

Lem   55:12
Yeah. So now we can connect this one to the whole flow and Yep.

Bryan Wolf   55:12
So.

Lem   55:17
And then.
Add to Black cherry app.
So this would process it and then.

Bryan Wolf   55:43
It.

Lem   55:45
No, this actually has.
It's actually pulling the data from that particular sheet.
On the ChatGPT filter.

Bryan Wolf   55:55
Mm hmm.

Lem   55:55
So we would need to like get another.
Another articles for from the first automation.
Oh.
Oh, it's that one.

Bryan Wolf   56:14
This is with the wine I was getting on Friday.

Lem   56:20
Reference module engine.
Not accessible.
Serious Model 2.
Oh, I think this it's for the create document.
Can you please click the create document?
The No no, just the the one after the one after ChatGPT.

Bryan Wolf   56:38
This one.

Lem   56:43
Yeah, that one, yeah.
So the the actually the content here is coming from different ones. So you should delete this one and then get it from the. Yeah this one.
The new ChatGPT.
OK. Yeah.
And then now we could save that one.
So yeah, so let's.
Yeah, let's trigger this manually again the.
Uh.
Can you go back to the like Google Sheets?
Then.

Bryan Wolf   57:17
Here or actually on the bushes.

Lem   57:19
Oh yeah, on the spreadsheet. And then, yeah, so this is already empty, right?
So we would be getting like another.

Bryan Wolf   57:24
I'm gonna empty this too.
This is too much information in here I think.

Lem   57:28
OK.
Yeah, yeah, this already like 257 actually.
Oh.
I think this.
Yeah. And then leave, OK.
So yeah, the thing here is if you like, click the three the trigger. Can you go back?
Oh, can can you put?
Can you put on the all articles? Just put like a word after the title.
Yeah, just put a like test because so that it won't.
Yeah, just just test.
Yeah. So that it won't copy the formatting and then also for the ChatGPT filter.
Can you?
Yeah, just put a test also here on the title so that it won't copy the like the formatting of the headers. OK.
So now on the trigger.
Yeah, you can actually like delete this one.
If you want.
Yep, and then also.
The team members, that's, that's again end to end.
Yep, OK.
And then.
Yeah, that's already OK.
Oh, and then yeah, go.
Let's go back to the trigger on the trigger spreadsheet.
Yeah. So then just change the date for today. So it's for so that that automation, yeah, the 16th. OK. And then.
Yeah, we could trigger this one now.
So run.
OK, just getting the ten articles.
Now it's feeding it to ChatGPT to choose the top three.
That will also for the other routes same.
Hmm.

Bryan Wolf   59:58
Excuse me.
Hmm.

Lem   1:00:17
Now so for the third one it didn't.
Yeah, I think I think it's because we're picking it from like the same website. So that's why.
It's getting the duplicate websites so the duplicate websites are actually not passing through.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:34
Right. I know 'cause. It's just, yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:00:34
So that's good.
Yep. Yeah, yeah, that's good.
So now we can go to the second second scenario.
Then yeah, let's we can now.
Yeah, trigger it manually again.
So I think this would process for like the six I think we have 6.
Can you go back to the spreadsheet our like the? Yeah. This one then to the ChatGPT filter.
Oh, so it's good.
It's only for the four.
So it's the top three and then other one.
And then, Yep, so it would process for this particular.
4.
For articles.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:10
Hmm.

Lem   1:02:21
And still processing.
OK.
So yeah, I think the first one is really good and then still processing the second one.
Can check the Google doc.
Yep. So that's.
Can.
I think you can go open the link.
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:53
****.

Lem   1:02:55
I just OK K.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:56
Sure, I can look it like this. This is fine too.

Lem   1:02:58
You can open it, I think on the yeah on that one.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:03
This is good.

Lem   1:03:06
Yes.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:06
Let me actually read a little bit.
So I haven't.
And the other one showing up yet.
'Cause it's still just doing it.
Yeah, it's still just so I can do it.

Lem   1:03:38
Yeah. The other one, yeah.
So the next one I think is already.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:41
Yeah.

Lem   1:03:42
Yep. Ready there.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:09
Hi I like this.

Lem   1:04:13
Yes. So the third one is.
Yep, still processing.
So for there there are also others that.
Add another layer of filter for the like for articles and like newsletter. Because sometimes like people can.
Like pick up if like it's from AI right? So.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:48
Yeah, they I think you can tell kind of with this.

Lem   1:04:50
Yeah. Yeah, there.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:51
Like you can tell this is from AI.

Lem   1:04:53
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:01
But it's not so bad. You're saying that people are going to be able to tell that this is from AI with like AI testers.

Lem   1:05:03
Yep.
Yeah, yeah, the 8 testers and stuff.
But actually it's yeah, it's.
I think it's using because I I've actually also. Oh, we're using anthropic cloud, right?
Yeah, because in ChatGPT you could actually reduce the temperature. And let's say from one put it to like .5 so that it won't use like flowery words or something like that.
I think you can also do that and like anthropic.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:30
Well, we still have.
We still. Oh, you think so?
OK, let's check.

Lem   1:05:36
Yeah, you can click it after the.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:36
Let me look at this new.

Lem   1:05:40
After it creates after it finish the process.
So for this one actually we can like automate the whole process and then you would only need to open the spreadsheet and yeah, then yeah, we would just need to change the.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:56
Yeah.

Lem   1:06:01
The like the scheduling of every module to like 15 minutes because that's I think the on the Pro, not the Pro plan.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:03
Temperature.

Lem   1:06:09
I think it's only 15 minutes for the minimum.
But yeah, it would because we we're not using web books here.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:14
For Claude.

Lem   1:06:18
So basically after we triggered like the trigger right?

Bryan Wolf   1:06:19
Right.

Lem   1:06:22
The trigger on the spreadsheet it would take like a scheduling polling like this.
This because it's like a polling trigger.
It's not like an instant trigger, so it will catch that particular trigger every 15 minutes so.
That's.
But if we use like other ones like the air table or other like database, we could actually do it on like a web book trigger that it would instantly update or trigger the automation.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:56
OK.

Lem   1:06:57
Yeah, but for this one we're we're just using Google Sheets, so.
Yeah. Yeah, it has a polling trigger.
It's also.
40 that's the.
So we have five articles.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:27
I think it's done.
Yeah, I think it's done.
Fine, but.

Lem   1:07:31
Yeah, it's already done.
Yeah, yeah, it's already done.
So, oh, we have.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:34
OK.

Lem   1:07:35
Oh, it actually added a test.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:37
Did the test, yeah.

Lem   1:07:38
Yeah, the test 1OK.
So it's just four, OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:42
OK so.
Now you're saying I can decrease the temperature in here or in claw.

Lem   1:07:48
Yeah.
On Claude and then you can actually go to like show advanced settings.
Then I just go down.
I Scroll down.
Yeah, this temperature as I see.
Nope.
Yeah, this one.
So as you can see, the higher temperature generate more creative and generative responses. So sometimes for you can like tweak this one to like 0.70.6 so that it won't use like like flurry words it will it. It will just use like a stra.
Like simple terms like, something like that, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:25
Nice, nice.

Lem   1:08:28
And then Yep.
0.7, I think that that's good.
Then we could actually use also like add it on the prompts like explain the article as if you're like a 15 year old, could understand something like that.
So it, but basically you could like tweak this one however you like. But yeah, for the persona it's actually already pretty long.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:46
Uh.
Yeah.

Lem   1:08:54
So I think that would be also.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:59
So I should put it in here or put it in the persona.

Lem   1:09:02
Yeah, you can actually put it there on the so that it won't use like the explain.
Yeah, you can actually add the IT to the prompt there and then see if it's not using using like the like.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:18
So what?

Lem   1:09:19
Very the.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:19
I say dumb down or.

Lem   1:09:23
No, I like.
Just.
How do we put this?

Bryan Wolf   1:09:30
Where is it in?

Lem   1:09:32
Like.
Like create, create the.
Post as if you are like.
This one.
Like.
Create.
Yes, if you're upgrade the post.
Like.
Change the problem.
Chain.
Fine.
Student can unders.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:48
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

Lem   1:10:48
But you're. Yeah. Yeah, I think this is good.
And then, Yep, so so whenever you like what?

Bryan Wolf   1:11:07
Is there anyway is there anyway I can test it like is there any way I can test that for just one just to do one more just so I can see what it looks like? Or is it gonna or is it gonna do all five again like is?

Lem   1:11:16
1 Yeah, yeah, we can actually test this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:19
There anyone I could test it to rewrite?

Lem   1:11:23
You can just put yes on the one-on-one because.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:27
Where?

Lem   1:11:29
The on the trigger on the I mean on the spreadsheet.
So, because actually this particular yeah, just one one. And then yeah, it will just process this particular.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:37
Like that.

Lem   1:11:44
Article so.
Go to #3.
The number 3 automation and then.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:51
Yes. Oh, no. OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:11:52
I add the other #3.
Yeah, the third one.
3rd scenario and then.
Yeah, this one.
So then just trigger it manually.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:05
But I don't want it to post to LinkedIn yet.

Lem   1:12:08
Oh, you mean what?

Bryan Wolf   1:12:10
I just.
I just wanted to test.
I wanna see what it looks like after we just add in the prompt like the .00 point 7 and see what it looks like now, yeah.

Lem   1:12:16
Oh yeah, yeah.
Yeah. So we could go back to the number. The other one, the 2nd.
Yes, second flow and then just unlink this particular.
The chat before ChatGPT.
No, that.
Yeah, that one.
Yeah, before.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:32
We'll just check it right here, OK?

Lem   1:12:33
Yeah, this one.
Then you can test it out.
I think this is.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:40
Or don't wanna have to transfer me to S?
Well, we can just ignore the asterisks that it puts in there.

Lem   1:12:44
Yeah, yeah, we could ignore for now.
So we just checked the like the.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:47
The content the main content.

Lem   1:12:48
Yeah, the content.
And I think can you why is it processing?
I think it's already done all of the.
Huh, that's odd.
I think it would be, yeah.
Can you open it?
I'm betting on the AI.
It's just like that.
Alright, see.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:19
Yeah, I mean, it's fine.
It's all the same.

Lem   1:13:22
It's trying to be the air for everything from research.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:28
So it's it's I maybe I shouldn't use students. I shouldn't use students.
I'm gonna change that.

Lem   1:13:33
Yeah.
But it's like posting it as.
Yeah, because you're actually adding an identity here, like create the post.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:44
It's not even in here.
Where is it?
I don't even think I see it. Oh, no. Yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:13:46
Yeah, this one.
Create the post as if you are a high. Perform for. For me I just we can just add the prompt like make the make the content as simple as simple make use.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:02
Use simple language.

Lem   1:14:02
Us use words. Yes. Use simple language.
Or words as simple as possible like.
Yeah, use simple language in the content.
Uh.
Then.
Yeah, I think you could delete this as if you are high perform because that's like an identity.
So it's actually posting it as if it's like a college student.
Yeah. So we just just simple language content all.
And then Yep, run it once.
OK.
Thanks it's.
Content.
Sorry, it's just a bit.
Yeah, that's that's.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:49
Yeah, I mean, it's all the same.
I can tweak it more, but I'm I'm happy with it.
With what it's saying, you know, I don't want.

Lem   1:15:56
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:59
I think we're good with now 'cause. Now if I if I so now if I wanna go back to I can just unlink these two and and put chat GP here and it's it's fine right.

Lem   1:16:00
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:09
Or I have to make ChatGPT, but the I have to map this with the with the PDF for Google for.

Lem   1:16:12
Yep.
Yeah. So what what we used here is I think, yeah, the Google doc for the persona.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:17
Right or.
Yeah. So I would just.

Lem   1:16:23
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:23
I would just take these three, unlink them, and just do these two down.

Lem   1:16:26
Yeah. The. Yeah, that three. Yeah. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:30
Or get persona.

Lem   1:16:31
But actually this you can like the last ChatGPT. You can actually just.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:35
Yeah.
This one or this one?

Lem   1:16:39
Yeah, the the this one, because this is actually taking out like the asterisk, right?
The weird asterisk or the hyphens?

Bryan Wolf   1:16:45
Yeah, so keep this keep this.

Lem   1:16:45
So you could actually, yeah. Keep keep. You can keep that one then just change the. Yeah. The contents. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:49
And just replace these two these two with these two or this one and this one.

Lem   1:16:54
Yep, the.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:55
This one get persona and create link to post or Google Doc and create link to post.

Lem   1:16:58
Yeah, I think what's yeah, just the gap persona.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:00
Oh, this is yeah.
Yeah, let's just delete this.

Lem   1:17:03
Yeah, just the this one for. Yeah, just the gap persona and then chechip the others, right.
Yeah. And then yeah, you could just map it out again and then.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:16
OK so.
Let's.
Now can I OK.
Let's just let's do.
I mean, I think I'm good. I think I'm good.
So if you wanna move on to something else, that'd be great.

Lem   1:17:32
OK.
OK.
I'll come again. Come with Brian.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:38
I'm good, I think.
I'm good.
I think I'm good. I think we.

Lem   1:17:40
Oh, OK.
OK.
Yeah, that's good.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:41
I think we're, I think you know, I'm figured out 'cause we we figured out really everything Friday.
I I just wanna get figure out how to get Claud working but.

Lem   1:17:46
Yeah, yeah.
So yeah, you can actually tweak this as much as you want.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:52
Yeah.

Lem   1:17:52
Yeah, but I think Claude has like better output in terms of content compared to ChatGPT. Yeah, I think so.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:56
Yeah.
OK.
So now if.
Yeah, I guess I can just.
I'll just run it and then it'll post it for me.
OK. But so, so let's take an article.
Let's pick one.
Should I rerun it and get or no, let me just look.

Lem   1:18:20
This is the. Yeah, I think this is the summary.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:22
So Maria, I just want to read these.
I just want to read them real quick.

Lem   1:18:25
Yeah, the summary.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:55
OK.
Let me see if I can just click the actual article.
OK.
You know what?
Let's let's let's do this.
OK.
So I'm gonna post on this on this first one, right?

Lem   1:19:36
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:37
So I would just go, which one is it crypto?

Lem   1:19:47
Yeah, I think that's the crypto group.
OK.
And then.
Yeah, you can trigger the the third one.

Bryan Wolf   1:20:09
Oh, wait, let me actually look at the content.
All right.
Can I can we rerun this so that it's it's maybe we can so it's doing the new Claud.

Lem   1:20:32
Oh, yeah, yeah. We can actually rerun that one, so.
With the new prompts, right?
Yeah. OK.
Just we can go back to the spreadsheet and then.

Bryan Wolf   1:20:45
I'll just.
Yeah. OK.
All right.

Lem   1:20:58
Yeah. And then.
Go to. Yeah, this one.
Then just add on the.
I remove the done done on the that particular article.
Yeah, that this one.
So the yeah, that one.
And then just add done on that there.
Yeah. So that it won't process this one, OK.
Yeah, I think that's good.
Then we could trigger this one again the the this one this scenario, OK.
Alright.
OK. And then you could check out the, the blog tracker.
So it's the. Yeah, it's AI.
Think it's the first one?
I mean the last one.
Yeah, this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:55
Yeah. OK.
That's probably basically the same, but I'm OK with that.

Lem   1:22:59
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:23
OK.
Yeah, OK. Now if I want to post this, I would just go to.

Lem   1:23:26
OK.
Yeah, you would click the yes.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:29
Here.

Lem   1:23:32
Then yeah, click the new for the. Yeah, this one then.
Yeah, if it's no, I, I, I. It's OK then.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:42
I just run this right?

Lem   1:23:44
Yeah, you could just run this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:46
It's the reason I went to this.
OK.
Now it's just.
Alright.

Lem   1:24:11
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:17
Posted right.

Lem   1:24:17
Then sure Yep.
I think it's ready there.
Uh. Refresh.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:29
Yeah. OK.

Lem   1:24:30
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:35
OK.

Lem   1:24:35
Yeah, that.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:36
You know what?
I love it. Lam. I love it.

Lem   1:24:38
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:40
Awesome. OK, cool.

Lem   1:24:44
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:45
Did you?
Did you have anything else planned today before, or did you know we were gonna work on this?

Lem   1:24:49
Yeah, there's actually a new flow that Peter wants me to do, the newsletter one, but yeah, for Beehive.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:55
OK.

Lem   1:24:58
But yeah, basically Beehive is not accessible for it's only for enterprise.
So I've actually told him to for the like the baseline automation we could use Bravo e-mail emailing for the newsletter for now.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:14
OK.

Lem   1:25:14
So yeah, I've started it actually already.
For a few.
For the first flow and then.
Yeah. So it's still not, it's still.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:31
Being purple Tweed to about, you're still tweaking it.

Lem   1:25:32
No, it's. I'm still uh finishing it does that one.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:36
OK. I mean.
Yeah, I'm pretty good.
I I'm good for.
LinkedIn Post if you wanna.
Do you wanna go through the flow of where you got already so far?

Lem   1:25:50
For.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:51
I mean, do you want to?
I mean, do you have anything else you want to show me or do you want to talk about me or or with Pete or Nick or?

Lem   1:25:57
That's I think that's it for now. After I've finished some of the flows, I think we can.
I can go over it with you guys, so I will also explain the like the thought process and stuff. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:06
OK.
Alright, just give me one minute.
I'll be right back, OK?

Lem   1:26:12
OK.
No problem.

Bryan Wolf   1:29:29
Hey, Nick, you still here?
Nick.
You can learn how.

Peter Wolf   1:29:53
Hey, guys.

Bryan Wolf   1:29:55
Nick's not here.
I'm gonna call him.

Peter Wolf   1:29:57
OK.

Lem   1:29:58

Peter Wolf   1:30:00
Hello.

Lem   1:30:01
They're.

Peter Wolf   1:30:02
So he was saying you had some questions or issues?
I didn't look in Upwork and lot of times lemme.

Peter Wolf   1:30:20

All the time either.
So hold on a second, yeah.

Lem   1:30:28
Oh, OK, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:30:33
You know what you could do, Lynn, if you have an urgent issue, you should. You should send me just a note.
You don't have to give details. Just say to my work e-mail and just say hey, check Upwork or check you know Gmail.

Lem   1:30:43
OK.
Oh, OK. OK. No problem. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:30:49

Lem   1:30:53
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:30:55
I don't really want to use that one, but if there's something important I need to look at or something that's holding you up, send a message there and tell me to check up work or my Gmail account.

Lem   1:31:01

So let me go over and check here.

Lem   1:31:08

What are you saying?

Lem   1:32:12
The.

Peter Wolf   1:32:13
I'm confused here.
I'm confused what we're talking about.

Lem   1:32:16
Oh, the yeah, for the I think the newsletter, the Beehive, I've. I've sent you a message on Upwork, actually on Upwork.

Peter Wolf   1:32:23

Yeah. So definitely.
Definitely send just a notice.
Don't put any details in there, but when you have someone up work to make sure I see it.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:35

Peter Wolf   1:32:36
If it's important, then please send the notice to theserrala.com alright so.

Lem   1:32:39
Yep.
OK.
I'll just.
Yeah, like a short message.

Peter Wolf   1:32:45
Yep, OK.
So I'm opening it up and I'll just put on a share here too, so we can talk through it.
OK.
Just go beehive.
And unfortunately they only have the create post API in their enterprise plan. ****, really.

Lem   1:33:11
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:33:11
How much is that?
Expensive, I'm sure.

Lem   1:33:14
On the app.
Yeah, they actually don't have like a pricing for the enterprise.

Peter Wolf   1:33:18
Christ Christ.

Lem   1:33:20
Yeah, for the. But actually we could use for like the newsletter I've in the past I've used like Bravo.
They have also a free plan and up to 1500 emails, e-mail, contacts per yeah, per for the free plan and then.

Peter Wolf   1:33:35
And what's what's the name of that one called?

Lem   1:33:38
Brevo.
BREV 0.
So they have a very yeah. Yeah. It's like an e-mail also.

Peter Wolf   1:33:42
BREVO brevo like that.

Lem   1:33:47
An e-mail campaign platform and they're very friendly on terms in that they're free.
Plan. We can like access their API and stuff.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:57
Sorry.

Peter Wolf   1:33:58
Unlock.

Lem   1:34:00
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:35
Listen, do you wanna stay on to talk to Nick, Pete or or no.

Peter Wolf   1:34:38
Hey, just give me.
Just give me one second here.
OK so.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:44
Nick, are you here?

Peter Wolf   1:34:44
Yeah, I mean this.
This looks like this looks like it will work. Lam you're saying for the same thing. What I was what I was looking to do, right.
And it has an API where you can feed it in and create a new a newsletter like that.

Lem   1:34:51
Yeah. Yeah, basically.
Yeah. Newsletter.
Yeah, that's right. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:34:57
OK, great. Then let's just use this, OK.

Lem   1:35:00
Yep, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:35:01
All right.
Anything else then?

Lem   1:35:04
Yep, this is only the the one.
Yeah. The bottleneck for that? Yep. But yeah, for the other ones.

Peter Wolf   1:35:09
That was the only the only real topic.
OK.

Lem   1:35:15
Basically, we would also use Inoreader, so it's already good.

Peter Wolf   1:35:19
Yeah. OK.
Good.

Lem   1:35:23
Yep, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:35:25
All right.
Thanks then.

Lem   1:35:25
I I just, yeah, I'll check the maybe tomorrow for the scope because we would need to get also like the thumbnails, right.
So I would also in the in the.

Nicholas Westburg   1:35:35
Morning.

Peter Wolf   1:35:38
Need do you need something more from us right now or you're good to push forward?

Bryan Wolf   1:35:42
Hey, we're he's good, right?

Lem   1:35:43
Yeah, I think it.
We're good for now. The only thing remaining for the the thumbnail.

Peter Wolf   1:35:46
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:46
OK, cool.

Lem   1:35:49
So I would need to scope it out also and I'll just message you guys.

Peter Wolf   1:35:51
OK. But I'm saying you have everything you need to push forward.

Lem   1:35:53
Yeah, yeah, yeah. As of now. Yep. Yeah. For now. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:35:54
For now. OK, you'll let me know if you need anything else. But for right now, you can push forward, OK?

Lem   1:35:59
Yep.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right. OK, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:36:00
Great, alright.
Thanks, Lynn. Bye.

Lem   1:36:04
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:36:05
Yep, see you.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:06
See you, Lam. Thank you.

Peter Wolf   1:36:06
Have a good evening. Bye.

Nicholas Westburg   1:36:07
Thanks Juan.

Peter Wolf   1:36:08
Alright, so nick. Yep. See ya.

Lem   1:36:09
OK.
Thanks guys.

Peter Wolf   1:36:12
So Nick, I was just saying to Brian, I had called COO today. I need to produce.

Lem   1:36:12
Yeah. Bye, bye.

Peter Wolf   1:36:17
I need to shift gears and focus.
Have Brian focus with any help you can give as far as direction and any materials we need to be building up that repository information right? The ramp up that we talked about, YouTube videos, web sites.
Content we can give.
Like that, 100 prompts whatever I need to pull all that stuff together and start building that into a comprehensive single location. And then he's allocating some administrative assistant that he has to help us build this repository, or to, you know, consider how to build the repository. So I.

Nicholas Westburg   1:36:57
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:36:57
Need to really make an effort of an X, let's say.
Two days to really focus on trying to gather that kind of information.

Nicholas Westburg   1:37:06
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:37:06
What stuff would we propose?
What websites?
What certifications?
You know, I already gave you the classes that that, that you guys took, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:37:15
Oh, Microsoft learn, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:37:15
So we wanna pull that stuff we want to.
We wanna look at any other stuff you have, Nick, that you've helped to build your skill set over time.
But again, thinking from foundational perspective, right?
And we're building this app to start with.
The people just getting themselves acclimated to to.
Natural language.
Processing large language models, prompting just engagement API's and that kind of stuff.
But I think the APIs are even like, yeah, I think when we get into when we get into the process flows, but.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:52
Let's start small.
Start small and dumb down.

Peter Wolf   1:37:56
Yeah, I think really, let's let's ******** focus on the other stuff on the prompting and get to know understanding large language models or how do you use these.
What are the different ones out there to choose from?
Maybe we put something together. Does a comparison on plans or something like that.
I mean things that will help these people to get acclimated to. How do you even get started, right?

Nicholas Westburg   1:38:12
Yeah.
Brian, you and I can work on that today. So I you know you've never worked with GitHub and you hear the word.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:21
Yeah, that's yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:38:26
You know, you hear GitHub and you immediately think of code and whatnot.
That's not necessarily what it's for. That's where a lot of people store their code and provide their code.
But really, it's like a knowledge base that is private. It's free.

Peter Wolf   1:38:39
OK, but hold on.
Let me just clarify something 'cause Gill brought you know, I mean you sent that question out about using this.

Nicholas Westburg   1:38:44
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:38:45
They're not going to.
They meaning leadership here.
They're gonna want to put this in SharePoint so.

Nicholas Westburg   1:38:50
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:38:51
For for you guys, this is.
That's great.
Whatever for you on the outside world, pushing and pitching outward and and showing visibility.
I think that's awesome, but I need to be building this repository and again right now just curating all the information and then we can figure out how do we build this into a repository they're gonna want to build an internal.
Into a SharePoint site and so really it's just now about finding all the information that we want to say. Look, here's 100 links to different things.

Nicholas Westburg   1:39:18
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:39:21
These are YouTube videos.
These are certification classes.
These are training courses.
These are prompt, you know repositories or we end up building our own repository but.
We need to be gathering this information together to then be able to facilitate that creation of a SharePoint site.

Nicholas Westburg   1:39:41
OK.
So like when I'm yeah. So I'm gonna be building this in GitHub, right?

Peter Wolf   1:39:42
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   1:39:46
But you wanna you wanna. You wanna get that over into SharePoint is what you're saying.

Peter Wolf   1:39:46
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:50
Or Google Sheets OK.

Peter Wolf   1:39:50
Ultimately, I'm gonna. Well ultimately right now I need to be able to to.

Nicholas Westburg   1:39:52
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:39:56
I will ultimately need to get it into SharePoint.
What I really want is the ability to say here's all the **** that we're gathering up now. If we're doing that by you building it into GitHub and then I can show her that here, here it is.
But I think for me, it's ultimately gonna be if we have a spreadsheet that lists all these things out.

Nicholas Westburg   1:40:15
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:40:15
And the the total scope of of materials. And then we're sharing them or saving them.

Nicholas Westburg   1:40:18
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:40:20
Folder somewhere. That's ultimately what I'm gonna need.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:23
Alright, so Nick, if you want to create a spreadsheet and send it to me or you want me to do it and then we can start putting it in there. We do. We do, we do, we do, we do.

Peter Wolf   1:40:27
I thought you guys already we were already doing this, right?
Yeah. So let's pull that together.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:31
It's hard in there.

Peter Wolf   1:40:32
What we already have and then we can just compile a massive list and we can start to prioritize them and categorize them.
You know, these are these are learning about the just LLM. In general these are about prompting.
These are about process flows.
These are about right.
I mean that's that's the kind of stuff I think the way we're gonna have to pull it together and then then ultimately we can figure out how we structure it inside of SharePoint.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:56
All right, Nicks.

Nicholas Westburg   1:40:56
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:57
So, Nick, are you already a part of the database research?
So I'm sending you access to this Google sheet or database research to njwestburg@gmail.com.

Nicholas Westburg   1:41:06
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:07
Alright, I just sent it.
So now you can edit and access it.

Nicholas Westburg   1:41:09
So what I think too, specifically with the prompts.
Because the prompts, as you know are are super, super important, especially treasury based, right?

Peter Wolf   1:41:16
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:41:17
So I have a really good idea of, you know, obviously I don't have the experience and treasury obviously that you and everybody else part of your team does, but I have a broad understanding and I know how to you know, search and and figure out how people are.
Utilizing prompts with Treasury.

Peter Wolf   1:41:33
Yeah. So what?
I would like to what we need to brainstorm. There is what's a way to manage those prompts so that people can even find them, right?
It's just if we come up with 100 prompts or whatever, how, where, how, how do you envision and we can talk about this. We can brainstorm, pull in Jill and and Bart as well. And just think about how would we structure it in a way that people.
Would be able to find what they're looking for.
I mean, do we categorize them and put them into?

Nicholas Westburg   1:41:57
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:42:00
A.
You know, into a either into.
Microsoft notes or something like that, I don't know.
I'm trying to think about what's a model that would be effective that people kind of hone in.
We build a hierarchy that something that we lay out and say, OK.
Here's a entire repository.
Here's all the categories we have here.
They're broken out into.
These are ones for general.
These are ones for prompting for writing.
These are prompting for. I don't know execution, whatever it is.
But pool together what we have and then figure out how it makes sense to categorize.
Them and then create some overarching document again where we would have in the SharePoint you'd have 100 different prompts and we'd have a spreadsheet that shows here's prompting and it's by category.
So you could just go down and filter and say I'm looking for category for writing prompts or for, I don't know, presentation prompts or something like that.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:51
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:42:53
So I think gathering it first and saying what are all the ideas and if we, you know, you had sent a link that was something like 100 best prompts, something like that. I mean I start with something like that and say OK, let's take that and say.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:53
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   1:42:56
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:43:04
How does that breakdown? And then we can put that into some kind of repository and then figure out, OK, for us and again.
This is this is broader than my team.
My team might have very specific needs, but this is for other teams and other people, so it's not all just about about Treasury. For sure, it's about broader stuff.

Nicholas Westburg   1:43:17
Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:20
Treasury.

Peter Wolf   1:43:24
And then being in the operations area in HR and all these other people that are doing their thing so wide variety is really gonna be helpful.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:28
Marketing sales.

Nicholas Westburg   1:43:32
Being able to scale it.

Peter Wolf   1:43:34
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:43:34
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:35
OK. All right.

Peter Wolf   1:43:36
OK.
So that's what I mean.
Let's let's try bang that stuff out.
And again, we got Brian with the heavy time availability of just need to be pointed different directions, if you if we have a list of you know a site that we can get the props from, he can start downloading the prompts and putting them into a spreadsheet and.
Listening to my app by title, by area, by category and consolidating them somewhere with links, so it's easy to access that we can move him over to.
A shared site. Whenever we're prepared to.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:05
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:44:06
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   1:44:06
Yeah, that sounds great.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:07

Nicholas Westburg   1:44:16
Cool. See you tomorrow.
So I I feel like I gotta get back to chill.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:19
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:44:22
But your dad kinda touched on that.
So.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:29
I just don't think.
I just don't think he wants to worry about getting up right now, so.

Nicholas Westburg   1:44:35
It will.
It's not worrying, but that's literally where your structure build.
Like building what he's talking.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:39
I know, but his companies, companies, I can own up, like if we can just take whatever you get home and just put it into our machine.

Nicholas Westburg   1:44:45
Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.
So.
Does not.
So I'll start with the structure. So all this is here.
Is something to visual I'm not sharing.
Can you see my screen?

Bryan Wolf   1:45:48
OK.
Yeah, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:45:50
So all that this is here is something for you to visually think about, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:45:55
Mm hmm.

Nicholas Westburg   1:45:57
So we are doing the serrala spark AI internship that is the main folder.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:03
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   1:46:04
Right, a readme is like, hey, you know, this is what's within this document, blah blah blah.
And this is kind of where you get those subfolders where you can start like program overview, you know what is this program?
I'm about, you know, the learning journey.
What are you know, what are we focusing on?
What certifications right?
Like what courses have we taken?
Like the Microsoft?
Zapier, et cetera, right.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:28
Is that happier?

Nicholas Westburg   1:46:31
You know what automation workflows have we worked on within power automate, right?
Like e-mail content blah blah blah, zapier etc etc.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:35
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:46:39
Right. This is just a rough draft, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:46:41
Right.

Nicholas Westburg   1:46:42
Chat bots, OK. And then within that chatbot folder copilot studio.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:43
Correct.

Nicholas Westburg   1:46:48
Another subfolder and then you have the actual bots and setups themselves, and then you have the sub folder within chat bots like custom, LLM bots or frameworks, right?
So you have all these different and then you have like prompting libraries, right?
So, like your dad was just talking about, like 100 prompts, right?
So you have prompt libraries OK. Within that you have different subcategories, so you have Treasury specific. You have general business.
You have technical prompt engineering guides that aren't just related to.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:24
Treasury.

Nicholas Westburg   1:47:24
Treasury and what not.
And then within that, you know it's linked from websites or links from YouTube videos.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:31
Hello.

Nicholas Westburg   1:47:32
Right. And then back to these other ones like Treasury, OK.
So what is treasury?
How can we use prompt engineering to help utilize?
Us in the treasury space.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:44
No.

Nicholas Westburg   1:47:44
And then you have a list of prompts here. OK, business wise general business, right? Sorel as a whole.
Meeting summary prompts like OK, we have.
We're having this meeting here.
What prompts can we use to get Intel information?
To help provide us with whatever we need, like the list goes on and on.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:06

Nicholas Westburg   1:48:07
Research, right?
You know, meeting, reporting, blah, blah blah.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:09
Right, right, right.

Nicholas Westburg   1:48:12
And kind of just build build it out.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:14
This is just a guide.
This is just a guide, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:48:16
Yeah, and this is this is a skeleton.
This is like a tree of thought, right on how whether you want to do it in an Excel sheet, whether you want to do it wherever, but it kind of just gives you.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:19
Hello.
Mm hmm.

Nicholas Westburg   1:48:29
A brief overview on how we want.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:30
Right. I'm gonna use this just to get started basically.

Nicholas Westburg   1:48:33
And I feel like I'm not like, I wanna put some more thought into this to figure out what's best for what your dad is. What? What your dad wants.
But obviously.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:41
He just needs results right now.

Nicholas Westburg   1:48:43

So you know what is it that we're doing?
You know, learning journey program overview documents serrala right.
Courses that we've taken, what we're currently working on different workflows, things like that prompts we need like whatever and then we need to find.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:09
100 problems also.

Nicholas Westburg   1:49:12
It's really just OK, so.
We just need to figure out how to organize this and what to include in it, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:49:18
Yeah, 'cause, I think the spreadsheet though you have here already like the the one I sent you, the database research. It's like you know, it's something great for making your e-mail or yeah in westburg.
