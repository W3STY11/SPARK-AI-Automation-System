Bryan Wolf   4:21
Now.

Lem Quimpo   4:21
Not it's, uh, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   4:27
Yeah, Bryan, it's it's like you're far away from the microphone. That's what it sounds like.

Lem Quimpo   4:27
Very faint.

Bryan Wolf   4:32
I know, but it's right up next to my mouth. I don't know why.

Lem Quimpo   4:33
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   4:34
I know it's you've done this before. It's like if the the headset's not working, it's picking up in the laptop or something.
So you can barely hear.

Bartosz Borek   4:55
Ryan, when you have the in the upper right hand corner right next to the microphone, there should be a little arrow down and if you hit down you can see whether it's picking up the microphone or the.
For the the headset or the you know the default Dell microphone.

Bryan Wolf   5:16
Can you guys hear me now? Is it better or no?

Bartosz Borek   5:18
Nah, same.

Peter Wolf   5:18
Still can't hear you.

Lem Quimpo   5:19
No.

Peter Wolf   5:32
Alright, so I got a newsletter here about.

Bryan Wolf   5:36
You do you got one or is that the?

Peter Wolf   5:36
Few months ago.
Or no. Hold on. No, this is this is yesterday still. I don't see. No. Hold on. Let me, let me, let me make sure my e-mail's been updated. I can't even hear you, dude.

Bryan Wolf   5:39
See that? That's superhuman.
It hasn't come through. It hasn't come through yet.

Bartosz Borek   5:50
Yeah, it's really quiet, but I did hear you just said it hasn't come through, right?

Peter Wolf   5:55
Oh, OK.

Bryan Wolf   5:56
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   5:57
OK.

Peter Wolf   6:02
Switch the Airpods Airpods. There's something, right?

Bryan Wolf   6:06
I'll have any.

Peter Wolf   6:44
Thanks.

Bryan Wolf   8:02
You guys hear me any better now?

Peter Wolf   8:04
Yep, perfect.

Bartosz Borek   8:04
Yes.

Bryan Wolf   8:05
OK.
Come.
No, I wasn't sending one. I don't know why. Lion, if you know why, or we should just try to run it again one more time.
I have it in the Gmail or mine.
Hold on me there.

Peter Wolf   8:45
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   8:47
I can't hear.

Peter Wolf   8:49
Can't hear who?

Bryan Wolf   8:51
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   8:53
Oh, let me still there.

Bartosz Borek   8:55
Lem, you're on, you're on mute if you're yeah.

Bryan Wolf   8:55
He's on mute.

Lem Quimpo   8:56
Hello. Hello. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think I'm on the mute. Yeah, so it's. I think it's just on the Bravo nodes on make.com, so I'm not sure if it's already it's synced with the.
Um, yes, it actually send this one.
And then?
Can you go back to the test e-mail to me?

Bryan Wolf   9:24
Uh, see. OK, so we gotta redo it then.

Lem Quimpo   9:25
Yeah, so it's yeah, so it's still sent on my.
Uh.
Yeah, I think it should.
No, no, we don't need to actually redo the whole automation because we already have like the document. Yeah, just the you can go back to the newsletter drafts. Yeah, this one, Jen, just remove the scent on that 4th.
Yeah, that's right. So we already have the like the content for that one then just.
Uh.
The.
Sent again.
Uh.
Yeah.
Then check the the number three. It's on the content formatter.
Yep. So that that nine, Yeah, 9/06.

Bryan Wolf   10:24
No, it's an older one.

Lem Quimpo   10:32
Can you can you try to remove first the yes and then just yeah backspace and then trigger it again?
Oh.
OK, and then just check.

Bryan Wolf   10:48
OK, it's working.

Lem Quimpo   10:48
Yeah, so now it's running. Yeah. OK, so yeah, it should send to your own.

Bryan Wolf   10:55
Oh, I think I just ****** it up by refreshing it.

Lem Quimpo   10:58
Oh, no, that's good. That's OK. So it's just not appearing. Yeah, it's processing. That's that's good.

Bryan Wolf   11:01
OK.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   11:08
Because it was already running a while ago, the.

Bryan Wolf   11:11
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   11:16
Yeah, the the the the ChatGPT content here on this like takes like 2 to 3 minutes. I think I could like first explain the while waiting for that one the Bravo stats.

Bryan Wolf   11:17
OK.
Do you wanna go through?

Lem Quimpo   11:36
Uh, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   11:36
So you want to clear one of the burgers or you want me to back out?

Lem Quimpo   11:43
Can.
Can you refresh the history? Maybe it's already here on the right side. Yeah, lower right side. Let's just check if that's still not there. I think it's still.

Bryan Wolf   11:56
Telling you because I I refreshed it, I think.

Lem Quimpo   11:59
I see. Uh, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   12:02
Oh, there we go. Oh.

Lem Quimpo   12:05
OK. Yeah. OK, that's good. So now we could, yeah, the sent is there then.

Bryan Wolf   12:12
The e-mail.

Lem Quimpo   12:14
Yeah, on the e-mail you could check the.
If there's like the test e-mail.
Walter.

Bryan Wolf   12:33
Oh, see, look.

Lem Quimpo   12:34
Oh right, I I yeah, I think it's because you haven't updated yet the lower part of the test e-mail to me. So can you open try to open the test e-mail to me?
On the diagram on the like the yeah, this one. So as you can see that that's actually like a longer scroll. Yeah, that one. So I see, yeah, all of that are still on my e-mail. So that's right.
Yep, this one. So I think that's why it's still.
Let me check if I'm getting those emails. Yeah, Nope. I'm actually, yeah, I don't. I didn't get the emails also, so.

Bryan Wolf   13:12
Yeah, you just uh...

Lem Quimpo   13:21
It's just I think uh like good like error out but it's not appearing there but.
Yeah.
So yeah, let's just double check if the e-mail. Can you Scroll down? OK and then the other one.

Bryan Wolf   13:37
So.

Lem Quimpo   13:43
So this is good. OK, it's good. OK, Yep. So yes.
Trift the trigger out.
Can you? Yeah, we we could hit refresh for that one. Maybe it would appear on the currently running.
Uh, yeah, I think it didn't trigger.
Can you just backspace that one? Backspace. Yep. And then click yes again.
OK, so that, yeah, now it's triggering. Yeah, that's good.

Bryan Wolf   14:52
There we go.

Lem Quimpo   15:09
Yes, we have. Oh, we it run twice actually. Yeah, it's OK. I think we can you check the.

Bryan Wolf   15:10
That's all. That's all.
Oh, here. I got one. I got one.

Lem Quimpo   15:19
OK. Yeah, I think it's sent the first one. OK, yeah, that's for today, 919. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   15:23
This is the test. This is it.

Lem Quimpo   15:29
OK.

Bryan Wolf   15:32
How do you think?
What do you guys think?

Peter Wolf   15:58
Hold on, give me a minute. I'm. I'm just getting it on my Outlook. Give me a second to look at it.

Lem Quimpo   16:24
Yeah, and we have the to learn more. So I've also bolded bolded the to learn more on the after the conclusion so that it's much easier to see also.
Then goes there.
OK.
OK.
Mhm.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   18:20
Thoughts, opinions, concerns that I also think it's it's sent to your your Gmail, not your Outlook, OK.

Peter Wolf   18:26
I have it. I'm looking at it. Give me a minute.

Bryan Wolf   18:30
OK.

Peter Wolf   20:48
I think it's, I think it's really good. Couple things. We're really gonna need to focus on the prompts because this prompt right here couldn't be used by anybody because it requires leveraging information that would be inside their firewall that they couldn't put outside, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   21:03
Hey, uh, Peter.
Peter, can you can you share? Cause I didn't get. Obviously I did. I didn't get an e-mail, so I'd like to see as well.

Peter Wolf   21:07
Yeah.
Oh ****, I'm gonna. I'm gonna afford it to you. Can guys, can you put Bart on the on the e-mail list? No.

Bryan Wolf   21:14
You can't forward it. Yeah, sure. But you can't forward it. It changes the structure of it.

Lem Quimpo   21:16
Yeah, I yeah, you could send actually like send send the e-mail.

Peter Wolf   21:20
Well, I'm going to forward it. We'll see how it looks. I I'm going to share it. I'm also going to forward it. We'll see how it looks when it gets to you. But we'll put you on the e-mail list as well so that you'll just get them automatically. Now hold on a second.

Bartosz Borek   21:21
Can someone? Can someone just share it? Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   21:24
Mm.

Bartosz Borek   21:24
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Thanks. Oh.

Bryan Wolf   21:29
Alrighty, yeah, um.

Lem Quimpo   21:33
Mhm.
Yeah, the E e-mail campaign list. That's right.

Bartosz Borek   21:39
OK, she's got it.

Peter Wolf   21:43
So in the past when we forwarded them they they distorted the the look and so you can't get it. You can't get a good feel for how the content looks, but so here if it is distorted.

Bartosz Borek   21:58
Yes.
Yeah, OK.

Peter Wolf   22:00
Here is the I think this is a I think this is a pretty pretty good here. I think we need this again this this is probably doesn't even say Serallo on it. We need a better header banner and I think now they don't want us using this finance engineered anymore. That's dead now it's like proceed with.
With confidence or something, accelerate with confidence or something like that. I think, I think these are good. I think this looks a little, a little sloppy just because the different line sizes, but I think it's good. It's really essentially giving insights into the content below.
I think these articles, this is a good article. I don't know about the generic pictures. At least this is good, right? It's from Word, so they've used a picture that went along with it, right?

Lem Quimpo   22:47
Yeah, I think this is this, this is from Inoreader. So the the yeah, that's right, yeah, it's from the article. And then the other ones because we added I think 2 from Inoreader and three from Perplexity. So the three below is the image are from Unsplash.

Peter Wolf   22:50
Oh, so this one is an actual photo, OK.
OK.
And so tell me again, when we have complexity, why is it we can't then go back to look up the the the URL and get the image?

Lem Quimpo   23:12
Image URL.
Yeah, it's it. I also tried that that one, but it can't like get the like the public access URL for that particular article. So that's just the.

Peter Wolf   23:27
But then how did? How did Inno reader get it? Because RSS feed.

Lem Quimpo   23:30
Uh.
Yeah, basically it it's like scraping the like the article and then getting like the image there for like the main image that is being used. So like the yeah, basically it's like scraping that's why like other summaries on.
I know reader is actually on HTML format, so it's not really like a text. So basically this they're just like scraping the article and automatically and creating the summary. So sometimes. So I think yeah, that's how they get the images for the.
The articles. Uh, Yep.

Peter Wolf   24:10
OK, I'd really like to see if we can try and figure out a way to get the true article image for the ones we get from perplexity. So let's just put that on the side though, and think about it. I think, I think, yeah, I think this article is really good, right? It's a threat.

Lem Quimpo   24:17
Yeah, I think.
OK.

Peter Wolf   24:26
I think this article, yeah, not so much, but that's us choosing, right? This is great. The survey is great. This is another survey is great. I think those are terrific.

Lem Quimpo   24:31
Yeah, that's right. Uh, we're the one. We're the one choosing.
Yep, that's from. Yeah, perplexity. Yeah, that's one.

Peter Wolf   24:40
Yep, I think. I think we only really want to do three articles. I think that's this makes it really long, but I think this is also good. So I think if it if we put out the first one is this article.

Bryan Wolf   24:49
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   24:49
OK.

Peter Wolf   24:59
This and this. I think that's great and we dropped the other two. I think this tech recap one good AI security.
Yeah, I mean, again, risk management, threat assessment.
I would just like to look at those socials and see if there wasn't something else we could get. Maybe this section should also be a little bit shortened because I just felt, you know, I mean, I was sitting here reading through it. Now again, because it's five articles, chop two of those out, I think that.
That is material. Uh.
Maybe it should only be 3 trending socials, 3AI tools instead of five. And like I said, this we really need to, we need to go and just predefine the prompts we want.

Lem Quimpo   25:50
Yep.

Peter Wolf   25:58
And make sure we come up with the good ones, 'cause this is this is the same right here. Uh.
Leverage internal financial data and industry best practices to blah blah blah. So I mean, nobody's going to put their internal financial data into this, at least an external prompt. Now maybe we could be, maybe we could be.
Pitching it from the perspective like we're assuming companies are getting internal secure A I, right? They have it behind their firewall, but does it have access to your financial data? I don't know. So I I think we need to be, we need to really think about this is.

Lem Quimpo   26:28
Yep.
Alright, sure.

Peter Wolf   26:39
If if we can create ones that people could use external without proprietary data, obviously they're going to be more generic, but I think we should do that because I think there's more likelihood someone can plug it, play it, use it.

Lem Quimpo   26:40
Uh.
OK.

Peter Wolf   26:54
Now maybe this is also just instructing them, giving them an idea how you prompt something, right? Understanding the kind of breadth of a prompting.

Lem Quimpo   27:00
Yep, I think we we could also add guardrails to like the Chachi Philly that is creating the prompt that for example, don't include like sensitive financial data on your prompt, something like that. So I haven't, yeah, I haven't added.

Peter Wolf   27:14
Yeah, don't propose that or don't write into the prompt that you're using. So write prompt, write prompts that would could be an external external LLM without threat to the company, but providing good insight to a financial manager or something.

Lem Quimpo   27:17
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, like.
Yep.
Yep, that's right. Yep.

Peter Wolf   27:31
Yeah. No, I think the conclusion is good. I I think it is very good. I think it's very good. The one thing, two things we talked about, you added this, that's good. The one thing that got lost somewhere along the lines, I wanted to add something here that was going to give credit.
To the people that wrote these articles.
The problem is I don't want to because I've written some of these, right? I don't want to give myself any credit because I'm the one supposedly putting this out. And the other thing is we don't really, we don't really identify that anywhere, right?

Lem Quimpo   27:53
OK.

Peter Wolf   28:09
So I thought we looked at that or talked about that or maybe I add my image here or something. I don't know. Again, I don't want it to be a Peter Wolf show, but I think we were trying to show this is coming from leadership in the STS practice and.

Lem Quimpo   28:10
Um.

Peter Wolf   28:28
Then down here we're saying, well, you know, here's some things coming from our, come from our, you know, consulting leads or STS leadership and then give credit to people who wrote these articles and we can choose pick articles that were written by others in the group, right?
I would like that. I would, I'd like to figure out how we can not figure out. I'd like to add a blurb that would say, you know, here's insights from and then give credit and we would need to, I guess.

Lem Quimpo   28:47
Oh, OK.
Uh.
OK.
Would that be like a static blurb or not?

Peter Wolf   29:06
It wouldn't be static because it'd be dependent on who the blurb would be. There'd be a template, right? But who you gave credit to wouldn't be static.

Lem Quimpo   29:11
Uh.
Oh, OK mm.

Peter Wolf   29:20
Right. I'll be. I mean, I think it's a great opportunity to showcase the guys on the team and say, you know, here's a.
Here's an article from John. It's director of Treasury. Here's an article from Bart, manager of STS, right? Or not article. These are there's insights provided by and then list the people and their titles.

Lem Quimpo   29:43
Oh, OK, yeah, yeah. About the author on there.

Peter Wolf   29:43
To give them give them some some visibility.

Lem Quimpo   29:49
Yeah, we could like add a column there that has the author and then depending on the article, yeah, I I have some. I think I got the idea.

Peter Wolf   29:56
Right. So if we could, we could, we could in the if you could walk this or I have the spreadsheet, right. So hold on a second.

Lem Quimpo   30:02
Uh.
Let me just think if.
If.
Yeah, if perplexity, I think, yeah, perplexity could also like find the one who wrote the article because I I was checking about the author.

Peter Wolf   30:20
Yeah, but again, the I got to figure out. I got to figure out somehow I don't want to put my name In there, giving myself credit. I'm the one who's supposed to be writing this, or at least kind of, yeah, compiling this or something. And then I wouldn't say giving myself credit for it because then it would seem weird. I'm the one who's supposedly kind of putting this out.
And then saying, yeah, and here's some, here's some insights from Peter Wolf or but definitely some of these are written and we would want to include mine. Maybe I just wouldn't give. We wouldn't just put my name In there. It's only when it's someone else's name saying here's insights from from the, you know, from the Team including.

Lem Quimpo   30:44
Yeah.
Alright, yeah, right.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   31:01
And then put their name something like that. That would mean that from the Team could also include me without giving my name, right?

Lem Quimpo   31:07
Yeah. Uh, yeah.

Peter Wolf   31:08
So I think that's a way to kind of generally do it and then give credit to the people that are that have written other articles or blogs who they came from other people. So if we look here, oops, what is that? Get out of here. Come on.
What is going on here?
Hey, what am I looking for **** here? I'm gonna go to uh.
This.
So here we could add In the blog post or if I mean if we do the generic then and there's nobody attributed to it, then it's not a problem, right? And if it's attributed.
We could say include a kind of attribution to the person unless it's my name and then just don't put a name, right? Say here's from the Team including and list them. But if there's nobody there, if there's no attribution.
Or if it's just me, then don't don't put the name right. So if I go back here, Sarala and go where is it? STS branding.
Right here, right. So we could say that that perplexity should look for the about the author and identify who it is.

Lem Quimpo   32:58
Yep.

Peter Wolf   33:09
So what's the prompt look like right now that we're using?

Lem Quimpo   33:10
Yeah, I think.
Uh, it's on actually on our documentation. Uh, I've added the prompts, but um.
Let me I can.

Peter Wolf   33:23
They just pulled up there.

Lem Quimpo   33:47
Yep.
So do I need to like share my screen for the prompts or?

Peter Wolf   34:03
If you don't mind.

Lem Quimpo   34:05
OK, Yep.
I'll share a screen.
So for the perplexity one.
Yes, yes.
Yeah this one. So the prompt is you're an expert. This is just out the format. So basically the user input is this one. So your task is to research a surround the blog post In this link and then I've added a link.
Then create a title and short overview, then search other.

Peter Wolf   34:55
Can you Can you cut that? Can you cut that and paste that into the chat? I want to try and make a tweak to it and see if it Can find the author and bring back the author.

Lem Quimpo   35:03
OK.
Oh.

Peter Wolf   35:07
And where does it? Where does it compile them all together? Is that a separate prompt or is it each? Is that really overarching it? It does each one individually. We don't have an overarching comment. So if it brought back the author, it could add that into another column In the spreadsheet, right?

Lem Quimpo   35:25
Yeah, Yep, that's right. So we we could add another here like an author. This is basically the prompt format, yeah. And then the we we we would just need to update the parsing of Jason to add also like the author so that we could add it.

Peter Wolf   35:32
Yeah, yeah.
Can you just Can you again, Can you cut and paste that into the into the chat and then I'm gonna just add author as output format and see if it can.

Lem Quimpo   35:48
Uh, this one. OK, Yep.

Peter Wolf   35:50
Well, give me the whole prompt. Give me the whole prompt.
Yeah.
OK, so In this, uh, OK, there's the link. OK, so let me. I'm still sharing, right? No, you're sharing now. Um, hold on a SEC.

Lem Quimpo   36:20
So.
Yep. Uh.

Peter Wolf   36:57
Oops.
OK, let me share.
Uh.
So I plugged In the prompt and then I added this this cache pooling one by Bart and then I'm going to add here.

Lem Quimpo   37:29
OK.

Peter Wolf   37:36
Oh, I missed part of it.
Hold on.
System output format.

Lem Quimpo   37:51
It's yeah, it's on the the second one. So the first one was, uh, actually not complete.

Peter Wolf   37:57
Oh, here. Oh, OK.
I grab it this right here, this right here.

Lem Quimpo   38:04
Yep, the from this. Yep, that's right. From the system up to the Yep, that's the complete one.

Peter Wolf   38:34
OK, now here output.

Lem Quimpo   38:39
The output format, yeah, this one should have and then I think we we would need to.

Peter Wolf   38:44
Oh, shoot.
Need to what?

Lem Quimpo   38:50
Update also update the prompt to like the instructions to search also for the.
Yeah.
For the.

Peter Wolf   39:02
Yeah, is that a separate prompt or is that In this prompt?

Lem Quimpo   39:04
Um.
Yeah, it's it's actually In the In this prompt, but it's just searching for the title and short overview. It's creating the title and short overview so we don't have the like the author on the.

Peter Wolf   39:18
So again, I there's not a single prompt for me to put In here. It's a multi stage prompt.

Lem Quimpo   39:23
Uh, on the user input. So that's basically because this is actually like a two.

Peter Wolf   39:28
User input your test is a search for surrounded blog post, blah blah blah. Create a title and short overview of it.

Lem Quimpo   39:34
Yep, that's right. We we we we need to add the like the title.

Peter Wolf   39:36
Along with providing the author of the blog.
OK, let's see what this gives us.

Lem Quimpo   39:48
OK.

Peter Wolf   39:54
That's not right.

Lem Quimpo   39:57
Team. Yeah, it's hallucinating, I think for.
Uh, Microsoft approach.
That's true why.
Yeah.
Um.
The link.
Um.
Mm.
Can you try to remove like the like the what you call that the bracket? Maybe it's also like.

Peter Wolf   40:41
Well, it's getting the right article right here, right? Oh, no. Yeah, that's cool. That's the right article. But for some reason it's finding a name somewhere. So let me just see if I can see, given that we're gonna always structure the same same way in the about the author section.

Lem Quimpo   40:45
Oh yeah, yeah, I think.
Yeah, it's just a Yep.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   40:59
Let's see your tasks to research. OK, create a title and a short overview of it along with providing the. What did we say? How did we show that?
Output inputs.
So.
Awesome.

Bartosz Borek   41:35
Is that a former employee or something? Peter, Tim, I guess.

Peter Wolf   41:38
I don't even know who that name is.

Bartosz Borek   41:40
'Cause I'm wondering if that's maybe like a name that's attributed to that website somewhere. Yeah, yeah, something like that.

Peter Wolf   41:43
Someone who created it or posted it or something like that, yeah.
Yeah, I'm. I'm thinking it probably is a legitimate name. I just don't. It's not the one we want, right? So let's see what happens here.

Bartosz Borek   41:58
So maybe in saying providing we should say identifying, identifying if listed because like we said, the author should always be there, right?

Peter Wolf   42:03
OK.
Create the talent and sounds.
Hold on.

Bryan Wolf   42:15
Excuse me.

Peter Wolf   42:32
Yeah, I don't know where this name is coming from. See if there's somehow.

Bartosz Borek   42:37
Weird.

Peter Wolf   42:39
Uh, edit find.

Bartosz Borek   42:46
Damn, right? Anything? No.

Peter Wolf   42:48
Hello.
Let's see if we get a different article.
There might not be an article sometimes because we said we would have like webinars or something. We had the landing page like this, right?
Or if we were trying to direct them to a webinar or something, it wouldn't necessarily have an an author there.
Maybe we just.
Yeah, maybe we just add it. Maybe we just go to the spreadsheet and we just manually because we have limited number. We know it turns off we have.

Lem Quimpo   43:43
Yeah, it's just we're we're also like recycling the like the blogs, right? Like we're just basically adding different ones. So I think we could add it a static also static authors on the.

Peter Wolf   43:55
Yeah, if we just put, if we just put a column and we put author and then we put another column that is their title.

Lem Quimpo   43:59
Yeah, on.
On column D, yeah, I think we could just put it. Oh yeah, that's right. On. Yeah, another.

Peter Wolf   44:07
We'll add author and we'll add, we'll add title and then um.
We'll just assume we're always gonna use STS so we can then make a blurb that like I said this generic says here's here's insights coming from the team including and then or some better way but that doing that that way there might not be a mention or author.

Lem Quimpo   44:29
Yeah, uh, we could.

Peter Wolf   44:35
What?

Lem Quimpo   44:35
Yeah, that's right. And also I would, I can also suggest that basically we're also like recycling the like the blogs here, right? But actually like the overview can be changed. We just need to like check, check the create summary from blog posting again if that makes sense because like we.
We can like delete the overview and the blog title and then process it again so that like the the over.

Peter Wolf   45:03
Yeah, but I wasn't intending it to be in the in the. Hold on, this is over. This is her blog, right? I was saying at the top of at the top of the blog section like an intro.

Lem Quimpo   45:12
Yep, that's right. Yep. Uh, yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, we we could just, we could add the column of authors on. Yep. On that there. Yep.

Peter Wolf   45:21
And so if we add 2 columns, author and we add, we add title and then.

Lem Quimpo   45:24
OK.
The title is. What's the title? Oh, OK, yeah, yeah, the title.

Peter Wolf   45:30
No, the title of the person, not the the type. So I want to say, you know, I want to reference the resource, give their full name and then give their formal title in the in STS practice, right? Again, give them recognition.

Lem Quimpo   45:44
OK.
Yep. Can we also like put it on the same column like the title or?

Peter Wolf   45:48
So.
Yeah, we could do that. We could do that title comma and their and their role.

Lem Quimpo   45:54
Yeah, because we're just, yeah, we're just feeding it also to LLM, right? To add it to the to create like the blurb.

Peter Wolf   46:06
Yeah, again, this is not gonna be in the OR. I don't know, maybe.

Lem Quimpo   46:09
And.

Peter Wolf   46:14
Yeah, Bart, what do you think? I mean, maybe putting the name in the individual blurb is better than the at the header.

Bartosz Borek   46:24
Probably in the individual blurb.

Peter Wolf   46:31
So where is it again?

Bartosz Borek   46:34
I don't know if I like that, to be honest, of putting the author name in that in that spreadsheet because it makes it. It's just like another step that has to be done, you know what I mean? So it's like.

Peter Wolf   46:37
No.
Yeah, but if it's automatic, oh, you mean manual, another step that we have to do, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   46:46
Yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   46:46
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   46:49
But we're curating that list anyway. That was not automated, right?

Lem Quimpo   46:54
The.

Peter Wolf   46:55
We're curating the list of blogs.

Bartosz Borek   46:56
Yeah, we we are curating that list and we have to keep adding things to it. But I don't know, it just seems like, you know, where do you stop? Because right now it's just, oh, we're adding the link and then checking it off. But if you're adding the link and then adding the author and then checking it off, I don't know, it just seems like.

Peter Wolf   47:15
I understand it's a little more effort. I really think giving people credit and visibility is good for them for exposure. It's good for us to our team to give exposure to show these are real people doing this and giving them like, oh, here's the, you know.

Bartosz Borek   47:18
Yeah, yeah, it's, yeah.
Oh, for sure.
Well.

Peter Wolf   47:31
Here's a manager of the team wrote this blog.

Bartosz Borek   47:32
Think.
Can we maybe update the prompt to say like, hey, on this page on the bottom section there should be an author. If there is one, please call them out and the author will like, yeah, I don't know, I just feel like there's.

Peter Wolf   47:47
So that.
Let's let's try it. Let's let's try. Hold on so.

Lem Quimpo   47:53
Or what we could also do is like separate the because this one is like already doing a lot of things. So maybe we could add like just a separate.

Bartosz Borek   47:53
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   48:01
Yeah, and it's and it seems to be working well, right? So maybe don't disrupt this.

Lem Quimpo   48:04
Yeah, yeah, like just a separate perplexity that searches just the author. Maybe that would make much better output.

Bartosz Borek   48:04
Yeah.
True, true. No, I.

Peter Wolf   48:13
Yep. Hold on. Let's try that. Let's just see what we got. Uh.

Bartosz Borek   48:22
Yeah, no, you're right, Lem, because when we tried adding more stuff that just started.

Lem Quimpo   48:27
Yeah, it starts getting confused. Also like there's if there's like several step or like instruction. So maybe if it's just like searching for the author, maybe it can get a much better result.

Bartosz Borek   48:28
So.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   48:37
OK.

Lem Quimpo   48:53
And also it's not really costing much in terms of tokens for the perplexity, um, because these are just like one website, so it's uh, it's also not really.

Peter Wolf   49:49
There you go.

Lem Quimpo   49:50
Yeah, that's good. Yes, it was able to get it. Yeah, I think that's much better. Uh, Yep.

Bartosz Borek   50:02
So you would have to add, you would have to add that step, right?

Peter Wolf   50:10
Combine the author with a comment and their title.

Bartosz Borek   50:11
And and then.

Peter Wolf   50:13
Title.

Lem Quimpo   50:14
Yep. And then, um, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   50:15
Yeah, and all the I if there isn't and one, by the way, if there is an author, there's gonna be like about a paragraph blurb about them. So that would have to probably be summarized, right? Unless we just want the author's name and their title.

Lem Quimpo   50:29
The.

Peter Wolf   50:30
Yeah, I think we just want to give attribute the attribute the the article to the author. I don't think we Can write the blurbs. We're already now running long space.

Bartosz Borek   50:36
All right. So just author and yeah, OK, yeah, that's too much. Yeah. So probably just author and the author's title, right?

Lem Quimpo   50:47
Yeah, the what will happen is like perplexity will search for the author and author title and then we will put it on the Google sheet and then there would be the the one that would create like the blurb is Claude.
So it's just like depending on how we want it. So it will create like a what? What's that like like a summary, like a paragraph containing this person and then their title, something like that. So it would not be perplexity, so it would be like a different.
Step also. Uh, if that makes sense.

Peter Wolf   51:23
Yeah, we are. It's definitely complicated, but I believe these things, these nuances really make it better when we. So if we look at, I'm just thinking about, well, how would we?

Lem Quimpo   51:31
Yep.

Peter Wolf   51:39
How would we do this? We'd say here, you know, Bart, senior manager, manager, STS, wrote a blog about blah blah blah or brings insight to such and such.
Right. I mean that's what we would do somehow be the the the link In the title and then put the author's name and say the person.

Lem Quimpo   51:58
Yep.
Oh, so it's together with the Yeah, for that, I think, yeah, we need.

Peter Wolf   52:06
I'm thinking, I mean that's what Barb was saying. He thought this would be better. I do think it'd be better than we don't have to write an intro section and it's really just advancing or expanding on this, right? And just saying take the take the title of the the author and their title and and somehow spin them in.

Lem Quimpo   52:10
Yep.
Yeah, that's right. We're just gonna update the cloud. Yep.

Peter Wolf   52:25
In the beginning, but we don't, you know, and maybe it's maybe it's consistent. You just say, hey, Bart brings insight into this topic, blah blah blah or I don't know. I'm thinking is it going to look too same same if everyone is written the same way or do we just say.

Lem Quimpo   52:27
Yep.

Peter Wolf   52:45
Hey, bring visibility to the author somewhere.

Bartosz Borek   52:47
I think, see, I I I just think it should probably have like a dash to give visibility to the author because after a while, I mean because think about it. Yeah, think about it.

Peter Wolf   52:57
That way we don't have to write it into the comments. It's really just the title and then we, I mean the article title and then a dash and that way we get full attribution. We don't have to change the blog at all. I mean the blurb.

Bartosz Borek   53:07
Yeah, it's gonna be like, it's gonna be like 5 people writing these articles, right? So, you know, within the third week.

Peter Wolf   53:12
Not In most. We're just attributing to one, aren't we?

Bartosz Borek   53:17
What do you mean?

Lem Quimpo   53:17
Uh, no. Uh, because every, every.

Peter Wolf   53:18
Oh, you mean you mean on the?
Hold on, let me let me just make sure I understand we're not having five people write one article. There'd be one author to attribute here, or most too, right?

Bartosz Borek   53:27
No, right, right, right, right, right. What I'm saying is that every, every time we have a new newsletter come out, like, I don't think the authors or I don't think the readers, you know, after a while he's going to be like, OK, I know it was either written by Bart or Peter or Mike or Jatin or Justin. And then after a while, like.

Peter Wolf   53:43
Yeah, but you know, at least that's. Yeah. But look, Paul just came out with one or I think I hope you reviewed it. I haven't looked at it. We got Justin. He's written a couple. You, me, Michael.

Bartosz Borek   53:49
Yeah, no, I'm saying like.
I'm I'm saying I definitely agree that we give them kind of like the the kudos just by listing their name, but by like writing out something a little more, I think after we'll get a little repetitive just.

Peter Wolf   54:03
Yeah.
I agree. OK, good. No, I think you're. I think. I think that's fine. I think we put a either we put that In parentheses. I mean in, yeah, In parentheses.

Bartosz Borek   54:11
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Dash or parentheses. Something like that, yeah.

Peter Wolf   54:19
Yeah.
Yeah, that's. I think that's easier too, because this first part, uh, or no, this is the perplexity bringing it all back together, right?

Lem Quimpo   54:30
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, the the blurb is. Uh, no, the blurb.

Peter Wolf   54:34
So if we if we say to the if we right now the structure is give the title then a colon then the blurb. But if we say give the title then In dash and then list the the author and the author would be In one field with their name and their title.
And then do the colon and then this blurb. So really all it's doing is saying changing this right here to say add this additional iece of information.

Bartosz Borek   55:05
Or should it be at the very end in arentheses?

Lem Quimpo   55:05
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   55:10
Uh.

Bartosz Borek   55:11
What's more professional? I feel like what I'm thinking is like when I anytime I read something in the New York Times, it just says the author. I don't get a bio of the author every time. It's just title and then author. So it's like, yeah, yeah, but what I'm saying, here's the thing.

Peter Wolf   55:19
Right. No, I'm that's what I'm saying. We're not going to do the the bio, but I think they should be at the top. I think they should get credit at the top.

Bartosz Borek   55:28
That's an really because they're clicking in the website anyway, so when they Scroll down, they're going to see everything, right? So maybe it should just be in parentheses at the very end.

Peter Wolf   55:37
True enough, but I'm thinking a lot of people, they aren't gonna click on this, they aren't gonna click on this and I want them to get the visibility.

Bartosz Borek   55:42
Well, look, I know, yeah, right. So, but instead of putting it in the title, I think it would just look kind of more professional if it was at the very end in parentheses.

Peter Wolf   55:54
OK. All right. No, I'm good. I'm good with that. So Can we make that change and we just at the end of each one of these In parentheses, we put the name In the. So we'll add the flow that has perplexity. Go find the author.

Bartosz Borek   55:56
I don't know, that's just my opinion.

Peter Wolf   56:10
And their title. Put that into a new column and then the format of the output is the title, then the blurb with the rationale or whatever the you know, extra emphasis and then the.

Bartosz Borek   56:21
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   56:25
It would say bye. Should we say bye or?

Bartosz Borek   56:25
And and by the way, yeah.
Yeah, probably.

Peter Wolf   56:32
And then we Can say bye and then the the the the author's name and comma title.

Bartosz Borek   56:32
Bye.
Yeah.
So Lem, just I think you have to kind of organize it also like a if statement in Excel because I think some of the blog posts don't have an author and if there is no author then I think we just leave the blank, right? We don't include it.

Peter Wolf   56:55
Yeah, although.

Bartosz Borek   56:58
'Cause we just started, we just started adding authors like in the last like few months, so.

Peter Wolf   57:02
Yep.

Bartosz Borek   57:07
Is that possible, Lem? Is that doable?
You're on mute, by the way, if you're trying to speak, but let me know if that makes sense.

Lem Quimpo   57:14
Oh, sorry. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, because the, I think the last part would be on the content, the the aggregator. So it would be on ChatGPT, so.

Bartosz Borek   57:30
But what I'm saying is like, can you make it smart enough that it checks if there's an author on the page? And if there is, then it includes the author. If there isn't, then it just leaves a blank 'cause that's what we need, right, Peter?

Lem Quimpo   57:30
What I could do is.
Uh.
Yep, that's right. Yeah, basically if like the column is empty on the Google sheet, so we're we're pulling the data from the Google sheet, right? And then if it's empty, so it won't add the like the by. So I'll just put it like a note that.

Peter Wolf   57:42
Yep.
We'll add that section with the parentheses, the by and the name if it's empty.

Lem Quimpo   58:00
Yeah, that's right. Yep.

Bartosz Borek   58:01
So we're gonna so we're we're gonna do it via Google Sheets. Is that the?

Lem Quimpo   58:05
The the the perplexity step, yeah.

Peter Wolf   58:05
We're saying that the perplexity is going to go out and find it and it's going to populate a new column In the Google Sheets. We don't have to do it manually. And if it's there, then it will put it In at at the end of the blurb. If it's not there, then it won't put anything.

Bartosz Borek   58:09
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   58:11
Yep, with author and Yep.

Bartosz Borek   58:11
OK. All right.

Lem Quimpo   58:19
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right.

Bartosz Borek   58:19
OK, perfect. That's all right. Good. OK.

Lem Quimpo   58:23
Oh.

Bartosz Borek   58:23
Sorry, I just wanna make sure we're on the same page.

Lem Quimpo   58:25
Yeah, so the buy has uh like uh parentheses or something or just uh what?

Bartosz Borek   58:31
Yeah, I I think it should be like example. Hold on, I'll put something in the comment. I think it would be.

Peter Wolf   58:36
Although I didn't understand what you said.

Lem Quimpo   58:39
Like, is it something like this? Like by then? Oh, OK. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yep. That's right. Yep. OK.

Bartosz Borek   58:43
I just put something. I just put a comment like with Peter. I use Peter as an example, right Peter?

Peter Wolf   58:43
Uh.
Hold on, hold on. I'm sorry. Are you doing the chat or something? Is that what you're saying?

Bartosz Borek   58:52
Yeah, I just, I just did like in parentheses like Bucket Wolf.

Peter Wolf   58:55
Hold on.
Yeah, right. Well, I would say More like this. It's uh.

Lem Quimpo   58:58
Oh, OK.

Bartosz Borek   58:59
Yeah, the.
Like brackets or something? I don't know.

Peter Wolf   59:06
No, no, this is um uh what am I again? Uh managing.

Bartosz Borek   59:15
Oh, right. With the title after, of course, yeah.

Peter Wolf   59:18
Yeah.
Hey.

Bartosz Borek   59:25
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

Lem Quimpo   59:26
Oh, OK, Yep.
OK, yeah, I'll.
Add this too. Yeah, I think it's doable. The challenging part here would be, I think the whenever there's no author that it won't put the Yep.

Bartosz Borek   59:33
Is that doable, Lemmer? OK.

Peter Wolf   59:44
In my view guys, if it doesn't get an author, we Can manually populate it In two, right? I know we we're looking for a non manual task, but.

Lem Quimpo   59:50
The uh.

Bartosz Borek   59:51
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   59:52
No, no, no, I I think I yeah, yeah. But I think perplexity can get the authors. What I'm saying is because for example like if the if the content doesn't have an author, we won't be putting like a by right? Like by author here.
So that's just, uh, what I'm thinking is maybe like Chachi Pity gets confused and like hallucinates something.

Bartosz Borek   1:00:15
Yeah, gotta test it out, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:00:15
Let's make this a little simpler. No, let's make this a little simpler. And let's just say there's always going to be an author there, because then even if the author's not listed and perplexity doesn't find one, then we populate one.

Lem Quimpo   1:00:18
Yeah, that's right. I I gotta test it out.
Yeah, I I think that would be, yeah, that would be much simpler of course. Yeah, yeah, because it's like like it's just pulling data from the Google sheets. So it it it it puts it there. The only thing is if there's logic behind like for example like if there's no author, don't put this one so that.

Peter Wolf   1:00:32
I mean.

Bartosz Borek   1:00:37
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:00:52
Would be I think much challenging because the prompt also for the formatter is already very long, so maybe it would.

Peter Wolf   1:00:56
What?
OK, so another thing I would say is we just populated and you know what, if there isn't an author, we just put by the STS team because it's it's not, it's not going to. We said we're going to put it in one field, the value with a comma and it's automatically going to just take that. It doesn't know its name and title, it's just taking the value in this column, whatever.

Lem Quimpo   1:01:07
Yeah, I think, yeah, that's right. Like by STS team. Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:01:18
Column is right. So then if we don't really have an author and it's generic, we'll just say STS Team and then it'll say by the STS Team.

Lem Quimpo   1:01:18
Yep, that's right. That's right. Yep. Yep. Yeah, I think that's much better. Yeah. Like by STS team. Yeah, I think that's that would be much better. That's right.

Peter Wolf   1:01:30
So let's do that. It simplifies all the logic. You don't have to figure out if it's full or not full to be able to, you know, move forward. There'll always be a value, but let's build the perplexity part to populate that if it's available automatically, and then we'll only fill in where it's necessary.

Lem Quimpo   1:01:38
Yep.
OK, Yep.
Yep, got it. Um, OK by s s team.

Peter Wolf   1:01:47
OK.
So then that that feels manageable and I think otherwise really it's us picking the right ones and then I think we're ready to send tomorrow. But I need to get the list. That's the problem. I got to call at 11 here and to make sure I set my alarm.
Set alarm for 10:55.

Lem Quimpo   1:02:14
Search for author and.

Peter Wolf   1:02:17
Um.
Because I don't know how we get that list right now. Maybe I could reach out to to Megan, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:02:23
Pause.

Peter Wolf   1:02:28
Hello.

Lem Quimpo   1:02:33
Author and what's the the term again Peter for like the author and author name and then the other one is just the title of the author, right? OK title or position something OK.

Peter Wolf   1:02:41
Title. Author and title. What?
Yeah.
Oh, you're saying the the OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:02:52
Yeah, for the author.

Peter Wolf   1:02:54
Yeah, hold on. Um, you're asking me this for the prompt.

Lem Quimpo   1:02:58
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, for the prompt.

Peter Wolf   1:02:59
Like what I wrote was in the about the author section, find the author and their title. That's the way I wrote the this prompt, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:03:03
OK.
Yep.
OK. In the about, yeah, in the about author section, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:03:12
Here, I'm just gonna give you what at least what worked here.

Lem Quimpo   1:03:16
Yes, I'll just. I think that would help also. Then just test it out and tweak it if.

Peter Wolf   1:03:17
Put this in the uh chat.
I just put it in the chat.

Lem Quimpo   1:03:30
OK, uh, this works. Thanks.
Uh, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:03:40
OK. Can we can we reproduce this now guys? Because I want to show this to Haley on this call this in an hour. Can we reproduce this but shorten down?

Lem Quimpo   1:03:42
And then.
I.

Peter Wolf   1:03:57
Um.
Actually, maybe I'll look through this. I mean, at this point now that was the wages trigger. That was from the environment in my Google sheet, right? We did this in my Google sheet.

Lem Quimpo   1:04:10
Yeah, that's right. If we, yeah, if we like send a new one, you will just like remove the process for like the articles that you want to like process. Yeah, 'cause it, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:12
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

Peter Wolf   1:04:19
Yep.
Yep, Yep. Undo them and then reset them and rerun them, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:04:25
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:04:29
OK, So what am I gonna do though? There's a few things. It's the banners.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:32
You're gonna have to go through and manually press some of these things and make those 'cause not all of them are turned off.

Peter Wolf   1:04:39
Can you say that again a little bit more clearly? What'd you say?

Lem Quimpo   1:04:41
For the content, but we already have the content right on Google sheet so it it can have like a just one test e-mail because we didn't turn on yet the like the scraping and then like the eye reader so all the one that's.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:47
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:04:57
Turned on our all the web hooks so it's triggering when whenever we put the check marks and trigger on Google sheet. So that's what I think Bryan is concerned about.

Peter Wolf   1:05:14
I'm not sure I followed you. So I want to, as we discussed, I want all of this active and live, meaning I want the inner reader running every day. I want the perplexity running every day. Starting now, I want it to be populating this and then based on.

Lem Quimpo   1:05:15
Uh.
Oh, OK. Yep.
OK.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:05:29
I'm sharing or not. I don't know. Let me just go back to sharing here. Based on the contents here, I can pick whatever content I want from these by deselecting these, which would mean that it hasn't been produced, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:05:40
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:05:46
And then I picked the ones I want. Maybe those are still the three I want. Maybe they're not. Um.

Lem Quimpo   1:05:46
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:05:54
And here I have to take the word processed out and then unclick them and then reclick them, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:05:57
Yep, and then if you just no need to unclick them. So the all the yellow ones are just it doesn't have like the automation system, it's just pulling if you.
Uh, put the check mark there. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:06:13
It's not actually going to trigger it, but when it goes and runs through it, it's going to look for those and so it doesn't trigger this, but at some point at the end when I click something, it goes back and grabs everything.

Lem Quimpo   1:06:18
Yep, that's right. Yep. Yeah.
Yeah, Yep, that's right. Yeah, it it grabs all of the the social social media posts. So on the yeah, this one. So the trigger the this one would trigger. Yeah, you can just click one. Yes.

Peter Wolf   1:06:25
Where's the trigger for everything? Is this it down here?
Right here.

Lem Quimpo   1:06:39
For that, so it would just.

Peter Wolf   1:06:40
And this triggers. This triggers the capture from all the other tabs, even though they were highlighted. This is the capture for the trigger for saying OK, now bring them all together. We've selected which ones do we want. Now this gets them. Do I need to empty this status field out?

Lem Quimpo   1:06:44
Yeah, that's right. Yes, that's right.
Yep, yeah.
If you want to get the if you went to get the like LinkedIn post from this particular set. So yeah, you could just remove the process and like remove all the process and then remove all the check marks and then just like check.

Peter Wolf   1:07:12
And do I? But back to here again, do I do I need to remove processed here? If I go and select these again and they say process and I go hit this, is it going to grab these again?

Lem Quimpo   1:07:14
For the STS blog.
Yeah, if you remove the process it would grab the three of them, but if you just remove one process so it will just process the one the one row.

Peter Wolf   1:07:33
No, what I'm saying just to make sure it sounds, I think I understand you, but I'm saying in order for it to be captured again, I need to go take the word process out of here so that when it runs again it looks here and says oh there's a check mark and it doesn't say process. That means I get these.

Lem Quimpo   1:07:37
OK.
Yep.
Yep, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:07:50
Right, because if I go put a check mark here, it's disregarding these because they say already processed. So in order to get them pulled in again, I need to take the word processed out.

Lem Quimpo   1:07:54
Yep, that's right.
Yep, that's right. That's the logic behind that one. OK, Yep, all of them. The only the only ones that has doesn't have processed is the STS blog posts and upcoming events because we're like shuffling them, right? Like like reusing them so.

Peter Wolf   1:08:00
Same thing here, right?
Yep.

Lem Quimpo   1:08:14
Yeah, they don't have the process.

Peter Wolf   1:08:14
OK.
Oh, the only thing with that is I think we should add processed in because I I even though we could be recycling them, I think we want to try not to.

Lem Quimpo   1:08:18
OK.
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:08:31
Right. I think we should be putting, we should be putting process in here so we can see that we already included these in one of the blogs, I mean in one of the newsletters.

Lem Quimpo   1:08:42
Yeah. OK. Yeah. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:08:43
Again, we can always say I'm going to override it and reinclude it, but that way we know we did include it.

Lem Quimpo   1:08:48
Yeah.
Yep, that's right. Yeah, I just, yeah, OK, yeah, I can because I actually just removed it a while ago because I was, yeah, I was. There's actually status process there. And then I removed it because I I was thinking that it would be like a hassle for the user if it like check checks Mark and then.

Peter Wolf   1:08:56
Oh, you did.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:10
Move the process again, then put check mark again so.

Peter Wolf   1:09:12
Now I think, I think we want to, we want to be, look, we got enough right there, right to go through 55, you know, and I think we have more than this. That's at least if we said we were doing 3 per newsletter.
And we're doing them weekly. Well, I've easily got, you know, there's 1518. I got six weeks worth where if I'm doing twice a week, it's it's three weeks worth. I definitely don't want to recycle them until I've gone through them and determined that I need to recycle.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:29
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:09:48
Alright.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:48
Oh, OK. Yeah. Yeah. That. Yeah, that's right. That makes sense. OK.

Peter Wolf   1:09:50
Right. I've run out of them, then I would recycle by that time. Maybe it's a couple months later and nobody, nobody remembers or it's a refresher anyway, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:09:56
Yep.
Yep, that's right. OK, yeah, I'll add. So for the upcoming events also or just on the STS blog posts, it's the.
Yeah. OK. Yeah.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:10:22
I'm still trying to figure out where the how the webinar is gonna quite work here 'cause the way this is is um.
If that that's do we have is there a webinar on there right now we have we have a link to the.
Am I still sharing? Yeah, so we have a link to.

Lem Quimpo   1:10:41
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:45
Yes.

Peter Wolf   1:10:47
Let's see.
Excuse me, resources.
Oh, it's seven.
Hold on a second, guys.
Uh.
Hello.
Um.
So if I go down to knowledge center and I say uh.
In Treasury Management.
Uh.
These aren't the man success story blah OK.
So story.
Video Oh no, not our videos.

Bartosz Borek   1:12:12
Estee Lauder. There you go. Right in the middle, Peter. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:12:12
Yeah. OK. Yep.

Bartosz Borek   1:12:16
Watch video.

Peter Wolf   1:12:16
So.
So what would happen?

Bartosz Borek   1:12:21
It's probably, it's probably gated, right? It's probably gated when you click on Watch now or Oh no, this one isn't. This is just a YouTube.

Peter Wolf   1:12:26
But even if even if it is, I'm fine with it being gated. I don't really want to watch it right now. I want to see what happens when we include this into into this format, right? So if I put this here.

Bartosz Borek   1:12:31
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:12:42
We're saying I can take this, deactivate this, drag this down.
And then I can click on this and it will trigger to write a blurb.

Lem Quimpo   1:12:53
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:12:54
It will.

Bartosz Borek   1:12:56
Yeah, I mean there there is a blurb there though, right? So it would just summarize whatever is.

Lem Quimpo   1:12:58
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:13:00
Well, that's what I'm saying. I want to see what it's gonna do as opposed to when it was a blog, right?

Bartosz Borek   1:13:05
Right. But when we go back, there's there's already a blurb on that web, on that web page you were just on.

Lem Quimpo   1:13:06
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:13:06
There's no.
I know, but I don't want to write a new prompt to treat it differently. I want to see how it acts with the logic we have in the blog post approach.

Bartosz Borek   1:13:14
Yeah.
Well, would it be any different or?

Lem Quimpo   1:13:23
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:13:23
But does it just gonna trigger your lab or what happens?

Lem Quimpo   1:13:26
Yeah, it should trigger the like the automation that create that that's creating the perplexity.

Peter Wolf   1:13:34
Brian, can you log in and see if this is triggering?

Bryan Wolf   1:13:39
Yeah, give me a second.
Um.

Lem Quimpo   1:13:44
Oh, so you mean this is, uh, the same link, right? So I think it's not a problem.

Peter Wolf   1:13:48
No, it's a new link. This isn't anywhere else.

Lem Quimpo   1:13:51
Oh, OK, Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:13:53
Because this is a blog. This one above is a blog post. It's not. It's not the webinar.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:53
Do you want me to check content aggregator?

Lem Quimpo   1:14:00
Oh, this is a webinar the the link uh below.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:14:09
So what should happen here? Again, because we took out the process, so we don't, I don't, I don't see anything coming back. So how do we did what?

Bryan Wolf   1:14:11
Mm.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:12
It would ought uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:15
Nothing's triggered for me.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:17
Yeah, it should. It should.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:19
Nothing's triggered for me.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:22
It should populate the overview of the blog content and also like the blog title with the publication date. So that's.
The one that should do.
So if it didn't trigger Brian or.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:41
Mhm, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:44
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:45
Let me take this over real quick. So.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:47
Yeah, yeah, this should. Yeah, this should trigger. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, this is the.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:50
This is.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:56
1.
So yeah, it didn't trigger. Can you can we double check the webhook? It's just I think on the webhook site it's not picking up the right.
So it should be on.
F.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:35
Are they different? I put this one here. It's F2.

Lem Quimpo   1:15:37
Yeah, Yep, that's right. That's the right. Uh.
Let me just double check this one.
Yeah, so the processor.
F2 Let me just check.
Column F so.
This one is.
Column F.
Yeah, it's correct. So not.
Can you can we go back to the like executions? I'm not sure why it's let me just see your.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:26
In here.

Lem Quimpo   1:16:33
1017 Yeah, this is just.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:38
Just not populating on here.

Lem Quimpo   1:16:45
Yeah, it didn't actually trigger. It's odd.
Can we click again the check mark? Let's just double check if not sure why it's not.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:04
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:17:04
No, no. In the spreadsheet, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:17:06
Yeah, on the spreadsheet.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:10
For this one, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:17:12
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:17:12
Yep.

Lem Quimpo   1:17:26
I.
Yeah, it's not triggering it.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:31
Well.

Lem Quimpo   1:17:34
That's odd.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:34
Well, welcome right, please.

Lem Quimpo   1:17:40
The Google Apps script.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:45
I switch these.

Lem Quimpo   1:17:48
No, but can you go back? Can you? I'm just checking. Also I have the copy here on my end, so the F is yeah, F2 is on STS blog posts.
Yep, that's the one.
I thought it's just my boss, yeah.
And.
Uh.
All right. Uh, I think it's because.
Oh.
If yes, yeah, I think I have. It's because we changed the IT to check mark and that yes. So last time it was yes. I can see here on the the app script it's actually yes.
This way, yeah so the the app script is like filtering it out if the column has yes so and then yeah I've actually changed it to check mark to make it more like.

Peter Wolf   1:19:31
Oh, it's supposed to say yes in there.

Lem Quimpo   1:19:50
Like yeah, presentable, but I think that's right on the on the upper side. So can you scroll up so as you can see there on the only act if value is exactly yes on the 16th line.

Peter Wolf   1:19:51
Consistent.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:51
Can you show me where to do that? Can you show me how I can do that?

Lem Quimpo   1:20:06
Oh, on the 15th line, 16th line, yes, as you can see only act if.

Peter Wolf   1:20:09
So we just changed that to a check mark.

Lem Quimpo   1:20:12
No, I need to update this one and yeah like rewrite it because the other ones here has a yes check mark and then the other one has a true. So for the check mark it's actually inputting a true value like TRUE.

Peter Wolf   1:20:16
Rewrote.

Lem Quimpo   1:20:28
And then the yes is for the other one. So yeah, we could also like like change it to yes if you want like for it to work right now like all the.

Peter Wolf   1:20:40
Why don't we just change the yes for right now and then run it?

Lem Quimpo   1:20:42
Yeah, that's right. Like the check marks here, you could just change to uh like uh delete them.

Peter Wolf   1:20:48
Up there, Brian, go back down to the one we're working on. Just take that out.

Lem Quimpo   1:20:54
Yeah, just change it to yes for it. OK, Yep. Um.

Peter Wolf   1:20:55
Yep.
Maybe just paste, copy and paste a blank cell in there and then write yes.

Lem Quimpo   1:21:07
Because.

Peter Wolf   1:21:11
Go copy cell H Yeah, exactly. Copy that cell and then paste it in.
All right, yes.

Lem Quimpo   1:21:23
Yep.
OK.
So yeah, so uh oh, it's error out. So it act already triggered, but um number.
Can you can you go back to the uh?

Bryan Wolf   1:21:53
Apps script. I don't know why it keeps disappearing.

Lem Quimpo   1:21:55
No, no, just just on make.com then open this diagram. Let's just change the search search rules and SDS blog post.
On the search STS blog post, yeah. And then yeah, no, just as you can see, the filter is true. Just change this to yes. Yep, that's the that one. OK, yeah, yeah, just change it to YE capital YES. Yep. OK, then click save.
So it and then ye save that one.
And then, uh, yeah, let's trigger it again and just remove that one, then kick S.
And then OK, so yeah, this should trigger this already saved, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:22:43
Mm.

Lem Quimpo   1:22:48
Oh, it's still not turned on. Um.
Yeah, just.
Let's delete first because this would trigger three times. Delete the record. OK, then turn it on. Then yeah, just add the yes again, just delete and then add the.
OK.
Yeah, so now it triggered uh triggered the automation, so we should get see the.
See that? So yeah, I remembered I that all of the like the trigger was on yes and then I changed it to check mark. So that's my bad.
Yeah, so yeah, it populated now the.

Peter Wolf   1:23:32
OK, so now let's let's see what that, uh, content is. See what it wrote. Uh.
So hold on.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:46
You wanna share your screen?
Where are you doing it?

Peter Wolf   1:23:50
Hold on, yeah.
So discover how Estee Lauder centralizes Treasury operations with Serrala in-house banking solution, boosting global efficiency control and liquidity management into two Treasury centers. Learn proven strategies, streamline payments, cash flow. I mean, that looks pretty good, but is this really the same thing as the blog was?
There's nice code which are implementing, you know, spanking unified payments and another discover. Yeah, I guess there's nothing that's gonna identify that it's a video, right? But.

Lem Quimpo   1:24:32
Yeah, I think.

Peter Wolf   1:24:32
I think it's. I think that's still good.
So we don't have to change, we can include.
We can include it just, uh, in the same methodology without having to change the functionality.

Lem Quimpo   1:24:49
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:24:50
Right. So that's that's good from my perspective.
OK, so then what we what do we have? Again, we're going to put the by. We update it so that when we get blogs, we're going to have a column that's going to have their name and a title and then we're going to include that in parentheses at the end after the blurb and it's just going to say by and then it's going.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:58
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:02
Yeah, the.
Yep.
Name and title.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:25:16
To have and the by should have a lowercase B like they call that a byline, right? So just lowercase B by and then the person's name, comma and their title.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:23
OK.
OK, OK, note that. And then yeah, so I would basically this is for the blog titles. Yeah, I I think I would need to update the columns in the up script also because we would move the columns here. OK.
No problem.

Peter Wolf   1:25:45
Alright, you're going to add the process tier.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:48
Yeah, also the status process already noted that one and yeah, OK, I would I I'll give you another Apps Script tomorrow. Brandon, I'll edit the I'll edit the our like spreadsheet. So we we need to oh.

Peter Wolf   1:25:55
Hi.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:00
OK.
No.

Lem Quimpo   1:26:07
What we can do also is you could also like just give me the like a like an editor link for this particular yeah yeah so that I can just edit it and then also like add the Google Apps script so that we won't be like adding.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:13
To mine here.
What e-mail said there? LQLQ.

Lem Quimpo   1:26:22
It.
Yeah, the LJ, yeah, LJ Quimpo. So because if I if we create again another newsletter, you would need to like map it, yeah, map it again to all of the. So I think that's much easier.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:27
LJ Sorry, I can't read.
It's just annoying. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, so I just sent it to you. See if you can screw around with it.

Lem Quimpo   1:26:40
Uh.
On my e-mail or uh, yeah, OK, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:45
LGLJ.

Lem Quimpo   1:26:46
Yep, let me just check if I could edit this one.
Um, yeah. OK, yeah. So I have edit access. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:55
Very cool. Even better. All right.

Lem Quimpo   1:26:59
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:27:00
All right. So what else do you got going on, Brian, with Len? You guys already had some session earlier, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:27:06
Every, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:08
Yeah, we hook it up actually a while ago, all of the newsletter, then test it out and and.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:10
Exactly.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:20
And I think you could already turn on the other ones, right? The like the scraping system and also the IO reader and also oh the the number 10.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:23
Yeah.
Just keep them all running.

Peter Wolf   1:27:30
Yeah, let's activate them all and see what we get as content coming in every day.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:35
Yeah, uh, the number 10. You could just turn it off for now because we're still not sending.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:38
Leave. We'll turn on 1-5 and 9.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:41
Yeah, the 1/5 and 9:00. So I also already created the flow for the stats. Peter if if you.

Peter Wolf   1:27:48
OK. And that's going to update in this, this newsletter draft section here, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:27:54
Yeah, yeah, that's right. So this would be updated every eight eighth day of the campaign. So I've added like it will pull out the date from the like the column I. So if the column I date is today, it will.
Uh, pick that up and then it will get the stats for that particular campaign ID. So I tested it. As you can see, there's like.

Peter Wolf   1:28:14
So you're saying it'll run a week after whatever this date is?

Lem Quimpo   1:28:19
Yeah, I I mean that particular date. So I I this date is I just tested it now. So to trigger it, that's why it's July 24. But as you can see on the last one, it's August 1. So that would be the automation would pick that up on August 1. If today's August 1, it would process.

Peter Wolf   1:28:19
But.
Yeah.
Oh, that's the date it should get the capture of the information. So if we ran it today, all this one is 7 days from today. So it's saying OK, it's letting the system know this is when it should go and do an update for the for the stats.

Lem Quimpo   1:28:38
Yeah, that's right. It will be.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. That's correct. Then, yeah, we would have the stats. So I've just tested it a while ago. That's why it's July 24 on the that one. So we have there like, yeah, send.

Peter Wolf   1:28:51
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:57
Keep.

Lem Quimpo   1:29:04
Uh, unique views. Also on subscriptions if there's any.
Yeah.
Then you could actually also already filter out like the all the process, so could just filter it out if like we have too much.

Peter Wolf   1:29:25
Right, but I'm not going to because we haven't really created one yet. I'm going to go through and figure out which ones we want to use and then for our first blog. But now I guess again the the the two issues that remain is banners.

Lem Quimpo   1:29:29
Yep. Yeah. OK.

Peter Wolf   1:29:40
And the e-mail list to be put into Bravo. And I don't know that I'm going to get those things this week. I'm going to try, but I don't know if we're going to get them or not. I'm calling in a couple minutes to see if I can somehow.

Lem Quimpo   1:29:41
Yeah, the banners.
OK, Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:29:56
Push this forward. Um.

Lem Quimpo   1:29:59
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:30:00
But I feel like this is, I feel like this is done. This can go to production in my view, right? Certainly we can always kind of fine tune and do other stuff, but I think this is done for now. Question on this here.

Lem Quimpo   1:30:07
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:30:15
Uh, so sorry, this was another thing. So it's uh, it's banners.
Banners e-mail.
Bravo.
And then the identifying the accounts and all that again that's that's something we update directly and make we because we identified we could go and now it's included in the in the scraper is.
Is is X, right? We just need to identify the accounts we want to look at, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:30:49
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, the the accounts. So we disabled it only a while ago. So a while ago we just disabled it because we still don't have handles. And then if we already have, we could just add it inside the appify scraper and then.

Peter Wolf   1:30:53
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:31:04
Yep. And also I just also want to note on the appify scraper, so we're using because maybe it won't be worth it also. So we're using like the $30 actor there. So then I've tested it also for like.
Two days they have like a two day free trial, so it's actually inputting good posts with. You can filter it as current. Yeah, that's right, $30.00 per month for that particular actor, like a scraping actor.

Peter Wolf   1:31:26
And you say that's what, $30.00 a month?
And that's appify. That's appify.

Lem Quimpo   1:31:35
Yeah, on Appify, that's right. Yep. So basically depending on the like the scraping actor, there's like a per run, others are like per month, others are like per event. So they have like different tiers depending on the.
On the like scraping actor. So the scraping actor also is like made by others are made by other people. They're like selling or like renting it out to other people. So and then Appify also has them has their own like native scrapers.

Peter Wolf   1:32:08
So you're just saying, OK, just to make sure I'm understanding. So we need to open an Appify account. We need to pay for a subscription.

Lem Quimpo   1:32:09
So I also just want.
Yeah, yeah, we already, yeah, we already opened. Yeah, Bryan and I already set it up. It's just that inside Appify you need to rent the actors. So Appify is just like a scraping marketplace that you you can rent like scraping actors there to scrape like for example LinkedIn.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:22
Have encountered.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:32:36
Post so we have for the LinkedIn. So the LinkedIn one is paper paper search like $2.00 per 1000 search. So that's much cheaper. But on Twitter I think they made it that one because it's much complicated on the Twitter API they they put too much guardry. So they have the one that is good right now is like.
The that one that I've chosen, it's but it's $30 per month. So I just also want to note if it would be of course on like the budget would be on budget with for all all of the costs. So yeah, that's one thing.

Peter Wolf   1:33:11
So $30 per month? What do you get for $30 per month? Unlimited or something?

Lem Quimpo   1:33:15
The yeah, unlimited for the Twitter, Twitter. Yeah, that's right for the Twitter Appify. So it's not included on the LinkedIn. So the LinkedIn also has a different credit. So we we could actually like top up the account by for example like $50.00 and then.
The $30 per month would be like deducted from that and then for the LinkedIn one it it's a separate credit so it's not the same one cause it's a different actor also like scraping actor.

Peter Wolf   1:33:43
But but do I pay per individual or I pay the Appify account and then it it subtracts from the Appify account?

Lem Quimpo   1:33:52
Yeah, that's right. It it subtracts from the from the Appify already if you if you ran.

Peter Wolf   1:33:55
So I don't have to set up payment a payment schedule to each one of them. I set up a payment schedule to Appify and then Appify takes the funds out of there, OK?

Lem Quimpo   1:34:04
For Appify. Yep, that's right. Yep, that's right. Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:34:07
At some point, Brian, you need to give me a list of any other accounts. I wasn't aware that I had this account. I got to compile these together. I'm racking up more and more accounts. I got no idea, no idea what I'm spending per month on all these. I got to get a handle on that.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:11
Yeah. Well, I don't think we're paying for it. Sure. I'll make a list. I'll compile.

Peter Wolf   1:34:22
Um.
OK.
Uh.
OK, good then. Um.
And then then you know whatever extra time again what time you have, it's just we continue to advance those the documentation that we were talking about. The other thing is I I I guess we need to look at the rest of the flows and again figure out what is left for us to say that they're fully complete I think.

Lem Quimpo   1:34:47
Yep, I yeah, I.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:34:58
The Yeah, I want to walk through each of the tablets. Let's let's plan for tomorrow.

Lem Quimpo   1:35:05
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:35:06
Yeah, let's play for tomorrow to walk through the flows and then figure out what else we need, OK?

Lem Quimpo   1:35:11
OK, problem.

Peter Wolf   1:35:12
And I interviewed a couple of couple of developers for Microsoft environment and and I also in talking with one of these guys found that there's a you can actually.
Grant guest access and really lock them down to the power, automate or power, whatever they call power, the whole environment, their power environment. And then I sent a meeting invite to Wilfred, who's the head of IT.
And asked him, I said I'd like to discuss this, getting a a guest access for developer to help us with the flares. And I thought I was gonna have to argue with him and he he declined my meeting and wrote back just put in a ticket for it so.
I think I'm going to be able to get somebody who's actually going to be able to go into our environment instead of secondary environment and and build those, build those flows so we won't have to copy them over. Now the downside is for the interns, I think it's you know you don't learn nearly as much, but.

Lem Quimpo   1:36:08
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:13
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:36:21
You guys can try and mimic and build them duplicates of them, but I think that's gonna accelerate getting these in because if you think about this, it's taking seven weeks for us to do. But in that where a lot of iterations about changes, adjustments, all that, I mean I think taking these and.

Lem Quimpo   1:36:33
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:36:41
Actually plugging them in should be material in less time, but there is new kind of framework, new functionality, new requirements on how to do it. So I'm hoping that it's not going to take more than a couple weeks to get them moved over, but I guess we'll see.
See, once we get in that environment, if I was doing that as a multi-step for sure, it would take even longer, right? We did it in an individual environment and tried to take it to the corporate environment, kind of like what we're doing with you now, right? Where you're building them, sending some stuff because they can export same way you can, but then rebuilding that in there, that's going to even drag it down further.

Lem Quimpo   1:37:07
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:37:20
But the worst would be if we were doing this manual side by side where they were only time we were making progress is when they were in there walking and in turn through building that. So I'm hoping we can completely avoid that.

Lem Quimpo   1:37:22
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:37:36
And accelerate the process, but that's where I'm at. I I should hopefully have someone selected by today and I'll put in a ticket to see what it's going to take for me to get the guest access and hopefully I can turn that around really quickly and by next week we can be moving these flows over.

Lem Quimpo   1:37:53
OK, so basically the new guy would be also on our meeting, right? Like to basically duplicate it to.

Peter Wolf   1:38:02
I'm not. I'm not sure how I'm going to do that because I don't want to. I don't want to have him sitting here walking through stuff that we're, you know, changing and building additional flows. And I want him what I'm going to have a similar situation where I expect.

Lem Quimpo   1:38:05
OK.
OK, Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:38:17
Where I'm hoping what my target is, is that we can give him the details and the flows from the documentation and we can have him then building those into hopefully directly in the corporate environment and then.

Lem Quimpo   1:38:26
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:38:33
And then have working sessions like these to say, you know, what have, where have we gotten to, what issues do we have? And then addressing those issues and troubleshooting them to refine the the tools. So I'm I'm expecting a kind of.
Comparative thing, but I don't, I don't believe. I thought about whether having you work directly with the the developer or maybe that is something I will ultimately do. I want to see how they progress in being able to take the documentation and put it into that environment. But it may be that I.
Have the two of you working together. Now that's could be expensive proposition for me and I don't know that I can. That's going to be financially viable, but that may be the fastest path too, right? Where you already have insights, they have insights in the new environment, but you have insights into.

Lem Quimpo   1:39:17
Yeah. Oh, Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:39:24
Process flow. So the combination of the two of you can, you know, generate that much more quickly. Hopefully that's what we'll see. We'll see, right. Again, I want to move these quickly. So that may be an investment that I need to make. If that's going to accelerate it, you bring in your insight, then bring in their insight and.

Lem Quimpo   1:39:31
Yeah.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:39:42
That's probably going to be the fastest way.
Right.

Lem Quimpo   1:39:49
Yep. OK. Hey Peter, got it.

Peter Wolf   1:39:51
All right, great. Then I appreciate it and we'll see. I got this call in 15 minutes. We'll see what comes to that. I think it's unlikely we're going to get the newsletter out tomorrow just because of these few other things, meaning we don't have a, we don't have the list in there and the Brevo and the.

Lem Quimpo   1:39:53
Mm.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:01
Good.

Peter Wolf   1:40:10
The the banners, but we'll see what we can do.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:14
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:40:15
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:40:15
All right. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Talk to you. Talk to you guys later. Bye. Yeah, great job then, Brian. Appreciate the hard work, guys. See ya.

Bartosz Borek   1:40:17
All right. Thanks, everybody. Great. Great work, Glenn. Awesome, Brian. Thanks.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:18
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:40:19
All right.
OK. Hey, guys.
See you guys.

Peter Wolf   1:52:43
Uh.
Oh.
Book.
