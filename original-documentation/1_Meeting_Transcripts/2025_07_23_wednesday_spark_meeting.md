Nicholas Westburg   1:23
Morning. Can you hear me?

Peter Wolf   1:27
Morning.

Lem Quimpo   1:29
Nice morning.

Peter Wolf   1:31
Morning, Lynn.

Lem Quimpo   1:32
Morning.

Nicholas Westburg   1:34
Well, thanks for sending that.

Lem Quimpo   1:39
Come again, Nick.

Nicholas Westburg   1:40
Thank you for sending that.

Lem Quimpo   1:42
Oh, the yeah, right, the documentation.
Yeah, so the Jason files there also is already updated all of the like the new ones, for example the news process flow newsletter.

Nicholas Westburg   2:01
So these are complete. These are complete and finished.

Lem Quimpo   2:04
Yeah, that's right. But for the newsletter, I I'm, I think depending on how the meeting goes today, but I've already actually tested it and it's I think we're, yeah, we're near nearly there, but I would also need the insight of Peter.

Nicholas Westburg   2:06
Call.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   2:23
But yeah, basically everything. I've tested it from like end to end, like from getting the data like the news articles and then all of the contents are ready using Claude with the persona.
And yeah also yeah I also updated the like the prompt. What I did is I I let ChatGPT create the prompt based on the like the sample that.

Peter Wolf   2:42
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   2:44
Cool.

Lem Quimpo   3:00
Peter also gave gave us for.
Yeah, like the first one and then.
Yep, I think, uh, um.

Nicholas Westburg   3:15
Peter, are you at home or are you at, uh, your parents?

Lem Quimpo   3:18
Yeah. Oh, right.

Peter Wolf   3:19
I'm at my house this morning.

Nicholas Westburg   3:22
Did you, for some reason your dad has the same name, unless I'm just going crazy, Peter.

Peter Wolf   3:28
No, it's the same name, but if I'm on my cell phone, it says PWJ or PJ for Peter Junior, so.

Nicholas Westburg   3:30
Is it?
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   3:38
I'm on my laptop right now, so that's fine.

Nicholas Westburg   3:41
Reggae.

Lem Quimpo   3:49
Yeah, I think also on the newsletter flow the like one of the important factors also is like the RSS like the content that we are feeding the.
I'm not sure if that's already sorted out, but when I was testing it from end to end also, I think Perplexity was giving much more like better articles than the.

Peter Wolf   4:18
You know, Ritter?

Lem Quimpo   4:20
Yeah, but that my inner reader was like just like finance news. So I think that's, I think that's why it's not the like the list that Peter, I think Peter give a new list of, yeah, RSS feed.

Bryan Wolf   4:32
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   4:36
And but yeah, basically.
Um, the perplexity one was actually, uh, doing a good job. It's like getting.
News from like intersection with AI Finance tech, something like that. AI Finance Treasury.
Tech and Treasury Tech and Finance.
OK.
Um.

Bartosz Borek   5:10
Hey, guys. So sorry I missed the first, first part. Hey, good morning. So on the changes that we made yesterday, kind of where are we right now? Are we closer to?

Lem Quimpo   5:12
Bye, Bart. Morning.
Yep.

Bartosz Borek   5:26
Um.
Are we closer to getting this thing off and running by Friday or?

Lem Quimpo   5:30
Yes, let me. Yeah, let me just share my. Oh, it's glitching out again.

Bryan Wolf   5:33
Ma'am, do you have a Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   5:36
Yeah, please.

Lem Quimpo   5:41
Um.
Oh crap, I'll just restart my like this.
Browser. I think it, yeah, out when I.

Bartosz Borek   6:00
Do what you got to do. No problem.
How you guys doing today? I've been good.

Peter Wolf   6:08
Doing good. How are you making out part?

Nicholas Westburg   6:08
Good.

Bartosz Borek   6:10
I'm all right.

Lem Quimpo   6:14
OK, I'll not share screen.

Bartosz Borek   6:17
OK.

Lem Quimpo   6:18
Share entire screen. OK yeah so I've tested it from end to end with all the updates. I think the our updates is basically not sure if we added like the prompt.

Bartosz Borek   6:27
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   6:35
Uh, I think, yeah, we added some.

Bartosz Borek   6:38
Yeah, we made a change to the prompt to kind of summarize it and then give our take.

Lem Quimpo   6:38
But.
Yeah, yeah, that's right. So Yep. And then, yeah, so the output, this is like all the data here is new, so it's coming from. But this one, like the news here are coming from perplexity research.

Bartosz Borek   6:45
Right.

Lem Quimpo   7:00
Because my I know reader is just is was not sorted out like the the I know reader of Bryan. So I've chosen just the perplexity, but it's actually picking up a good news like better news articles. So and then yeah.

Bartosz Borek   7:13
OK. Bryan, would you, Bryan, did you make this?

Peter Wolf   7:16
Perplexity is or in a reader? Hold on, is in a reader picking up some good stuff now or no?

Lem Quimpo   7:18
The.

Bartosz Borek   7:19
Oh, hey, Peter.

Lem Quimpo   7:22
The perplexity. Yep. Oh, OK, OK, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   7:22
I was able to link the sources that you set, or most of them. Lem has it set up to where he's using perplexity to desire. It was not up to these hours or mine, which is also yours.

Nicholas Westburg   7:34
I was messing around with perplexity too. They pull a lot of really good articles.

Lem Quimpo   7:38
Yep.
Yeah, that's right. It's actually getting good articles like because it's getting the, it's actually getting the context of intersection of like AI or tech with finance and treasury. So I think that's and then we also have like a list.

Peter Wolf   7:54
OK, so here's the thing, just from a from a from a process perspective, from the kind of showcasing window dressing, I think we leave the inner reader in anyway and because I think it's good for for the interns for kind of showing the breadth of their experience.

Lem Quimpo   8:05
OK.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   8:13
Have an InnoReader feed with RSS. You know, RSS feed I think is a a good addition, even if it turns out that that the the good content is going to come from perplexity. Great. So maybe we we downgrade the the articles that are being chosen by InnoReader just to keep any kind of.

Lem Quimpo   8:26
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   8:33
Yeah, just excess crap showing up there and we'll leverage the leverage the perplexity content more.

Lem Quimpo   8:37
Yep.
Yeah, that's right. And we could also like check because we have like the source here on the right side. So we could actually like if.

Peter Wolf   8:46
Yeah.
As we're seeing them, see what's what's turning out to be good or whatever.
Oh, you mean from a selection criteria what we want to choose? Again, let's leave the inner reader roll to see if we get decent stuff from inner reader. But it appears that the perplexity is coming up. At least every time we've done a search independent ad hoc with perplexity has come up with better content.

Lem Quimpo   8:55
Nope. What I mean, yeah, like the source.
OK, Yep.
Yep. Yeah, basically.

Peter Wolf   9:11
Than the inner reader, right? It's doing a broader search and and you're saying coming back with the relevant stuff is better and the whole kind of combination there seems to be a better option.

Lem Quimpo   9:21
Yep, Yep, that's right. And then, yeah, and also, so yeah, the articles now like the blurb is something like this. So the first sentence is like an overview of the article.

Peter Wolf   9:24
OK.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   9:37
And then the second, like the second part is like an angle for like corporate treasures. Yeah, something like that. Then yeah, same as this one.

Peter Wolf   9:41
Nice. I like it, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   9:45
OK. So yeah, that's the prompt we work. Yeah, that's the prompt we worked on earlier, Peter. So that's.

Peter Wolf   9:49
Yeah, OK, stop. Let me just. Hey, for some reason I'm not getting these right now.

Lem Quimpo   9:50
Yeah, that's right. It's uh, from the prompt.
Uh, yeah, I.

Peter Wolf   9:56
I I looked in my folder.

Bryan Wolf   9:57
That's 'cause Lem's just I don't have your Bravo set up either.
Here we got it, yeah.

Peter Wolf   10:13
Can you forward this e-mail right now so we Can take a look at it?

Bryan Wolf   10:14
Well, when we forward it, it gets, and when we forward it, it loses its structure.

Lem Quimpo   10:18
Yeah, when we forward it, it gets mashed up, but I think, yeah, I Can open my. I think it's here or on the other side because it's already In the campaign, so I'll just.

Peter Wolf   10:20
Good.

Lem Quimpo   10:33
Send it to you guys so you Can see this one. So this was the newest campaign and then I have you guys also actually on the list. Let me just check my.
So yeah, this is also important when we send the like the contacts In the Bravo. So we would have like a list, right? And then we could add the e-mail here one by one or we could like import the contacts from the CSV and then.

Bryan Wolf   10:56
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   10:56
Yeah.
Yeah, we're gonna have to import 'cause I I'm gonna use that initial list we have. I think it's like 1000 names.

Lem Quimpo   11:05
Yep.
OK, and then yeah, and then Yep. So what Will happen is we would also set this up on the Bravo that it would pick up this list to send the emails to and then Yep. So let me just go back to the campaigns and send the.

Peter Wolf   11:10
That's the mail addresses.

Bryan Wolf   11:19
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   11:26
Yes, send this e-mail to you guys.
Also 'cause it's also like.
On a free plan like maybe 5 to 10 minutes before it sends all of the e-mail. So I I'll just send it first. But yeah, so basically it's right now like this and then what I did also for the like the.
So the social signals are actually all from LinkedIn as of now, but I've already prepared the Twitter like the Twitter scraper for because I tried perplexity and it's.
Like frequently hallucinating. Yeah, it's a frequent. So I think it would be much better if you could find like just Twitter accounts that has.

Peter Wolf   12:09
Not working well.
OK.
Did we, did we do that? Did we go through that search guys to come up with a set of Twitter accounts?

Lem Quimpo   12:25
Yeah, I also made made a search, but it's pretty hard to get like people, people whose niche are intersection with AI In finance because most of them are really like talking about if their niche is.

Bryan Wolf   12:27
I have not done a search for for.
Or Nick did, actually.

Lem Quimpo   12:45
Niche is like AI, they just talk about like pure AI and then if their niche is like finance, they talk about mostly finance. So when I saw like when I search also on perplexity like the one on your list, so there are it's actually.
Getting the like finance people that are like really not posting on the Twitter. But on LinkedIn there are like a lot of people that are talking about AA finance intersection. But yeah, on LinkedIn it's actually good. So let me check for example.

Peter Wolf   13:12
So are we getting good content from LinkedIn?

Lem Quimpo   13:22
This one, so weekly.
So it's, yeah, like this what happened last week In the treasury technology field. So it's like talking about, yeah, like.

Peter Wolf   13:35
Yeah, no, that's good. And what is she? So she's linking to other, she's linking to other posts or one of those links she has.

Lem Quimpo   13:43
Yeah, basically I think these are like news article also. So let me just check. Yeah, it's like a news article also. And then yeah, basically these are she's thinking like news articles.
And then this this.

Peter Wolf   14:00
So she's just like a consolidator. She she only got 833 followers too, and she's trying to get herself a foundation here where she's consolidating articles In a centralized place or consolidating. Yeah, articles, I guess they are, right? Not other LinkedIn posts.

Lem Quimpo   14:03
Uh uh.
Yeah.
Yeah, uh.
Yep. Um, yeah, that's right. Uh.

Peter Wolf   14:18
Or are they LinkedIn posts? They are LinkedIn posts.

Lem Quimpo   14:21
But these people are actually from also from the list, so I'm not sure if all of her all of her posts are some like like that. But yeah, basically all of them are from our posts. So for example this one like the I powered cybersecurity.

Bryan Wolf   14:27
Mm.

Lem Quimpo   14:40
So because we have a list, right, that is talking about, yeah, so this is artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. So yeah, mostly on LinkedIn, they, yeah, there we have More content there that talks about AI and finance like intersection.

Bryan Wolf   14:45
This guy's better quad.

Peter Wolf   14:48
Yeah, good.
OK, I'm I'm fine with that. I mean, again, LinkedIn is business oriented, so if we're just pulling LinkedIn content as long as we Can get a decent amount, I'm fine with that.

Lem Quimpo   14:58
Yep.
Yeah, that's right.
Yep, that's right. Yeah. So it's actually.

Peter Wolf   15:06
So show me again on the spreadsheet. We're doing the same thing, right? The that goes to the spreadsheet as well and we choose no.

Lem Quimpo   15:10
Yes.
Yeah, that's right. It's automatically going here on the spreadsheet. So this is auto populated every day. So we have LinkedIn and then I think ready to deprecate this one. But yeah, basically we Will get.
Daily LinkedIn posts like top three. So what I did here is I changed it to top five, top five posts. So top five posts every day. So every day this would populate 5 LinkedIn posts and deduplicate also like the.

Peter Wolf   15:35
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   15:44
Like the links that are already like the content that is already here. Um.

Peter Wolf   15:48
Yeah, hey, so so just let me make sure I'm understanding. Brian, you're saying that this is LEM setup? Is my setup not ready, not going? What is this?

Bryan Wolf   15:56
Yeah.
Well, it's it's a lesser version because he obviously worked on this last night, right? So I updated the updates that we had from yesterday and implemented into our make. So once once we once we clarify what this looks like, me and Len will work together and obviously implement it into our newsletter.

Lem Quimpo   16:05
Uh.
Yeah, we have some.
Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   16:16
Whatever changes he made from last night to the spreadsheet, the spreadsheet to the flow to whatever.

Peter Wolf   16:22
Yeah, but there wasn't that many things he changed last night, right? I mean, he put In the perplexity. Or wasn't that even a couple days ago?

Lem Quimpo   16:22
It I.
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   16:28
Yeah, that's it.
No, that was. I don't know. Did you put in last night?

Lem Quimpo   16:30
Yeah, um.
Yeah, I I.

Bryan Wolf   16:34
Ours looks very, very similar.

Lem Quimpo   16:37
Yeah, that's right. Uh, we have just, we just, I think, uh, some of this are.

Peter Wolf   16:41
Then all of a sudden you got quiet. It's hard to hear you.

Lem Quimpo   16:43
Um, hello. Uh, Yep, yeah, uh.

Peter Wolf   16:46
Yeah, better.

Lem Quimpo   16:49
Yes, some of actually some of the like the automations I didn't updated because it's already good. So the ones that I've updated, I I think this one like the two, three, two, number one and #2 especially and then nine, yeah that's the.

Bryan Wolf   17:00
239.

Lem Quimpo   17:06
The most recent one and then oh right, I've also updated like the upcoming events. I've already used perplexity also for the art upcoming events and AI tools, no upcoming events and the daily insights, so we're already using perplexity.
Because we test, uh, yeah, I think last night also we tested it too.
Search for the links for your daily insights and also the upcoming events. So now it's actually like picking up like the particular link and then it's like summarizing like the over giving an overview of the like the.
The blog post and also the this one, the upcoming events, so it's actually good. And then what I also did on the prompt of the day because we have that on the scrape system, right? Like we're searching the viral prompts, but what I did is.
I I fed ChatGPT or like past past prompt and it yeah outputted like like some kind of that one. So as we Can see In the prompt we could.

Peter Wolf   18:18
Sample.

Lem Quimpo   18:20
Yeah, I've added this it as a sample and then it would it Will just tweak based on three topics like treasury finance and treasury finance.
Let me just check again. It was 3 topics and then the yeah, Forex, Treasury, Finance research. So basically it Will like edit the sample.

Bryan Wolf   18:42
Mm.

Lem Quimpo   18:48
Prompt this was this is the sample like prompt example the one that you.

Bryan Wolf   18:51
Do we keep 4X in there? I feel like 4X is.

Lem Quimpo   18:54
Uh.
Yeah, I'm not sure also, but I think this is 4X. The first prompt that we have is like a 4X exposure or something. Yeah, so I've added it as a sample. Maybe we could also like add another sample here, like 2-3 samples and then.

Peter Wolf   19:01
Yeah, foreign exchange. Yeah, yeah.
And I'm sorry, so what's the sample being used for? To find other similar prompts or to develop other similar prompts?

Lem Quimpo   19:16
Yeah, to develop a a prompt. So like because if we don't give a like a a sample it Will just put like I think like one paragraph and it's not really structured well, but if we put it.

Peter Wolf   19:29
OK, so hold on. So just to make sure, so this this particular flow is is going to AI and telling it to create new prompts that are similar In nature to this and that are focused on.

Lem Quimpo   19:32
OK.
Uh.
Yep, that's right. Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   19:44
Treasury, finance, etcetera.

Lem Quimpo   19:46
Yeah, it Will choose depending on three topics. So yeah, that's right. So that it would like also create different prompts for every like every time, for example. So this one actually is already a new prompt. So this was this is like.
A different one than you gave you gave first gave me, right? Because our plan is to create it manually. That's I think that was the initial plan. You would create it manually and then and then we would put it here on the prompt of the day.
Of the day. So I I just added it so that we could have like every day we could also choose like an automated prompt here. But basically you could also add a manual prompt of course here on the yeah. So I like I changed the flow to not search the Internet for viral prompts, but basically.

Bryan Wolf   20:22
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   20:27
Yeah, yeah.
OK.
OK. Yeah, that's I I think that's much better because I don't think you're going to find consistently find some comprehensive prompt that you're going to get to be exactly the area that they mean we want, you know. But again here we can, we can go and take, you know.

Lem Quimpo   20:40
Just to create that.
Yep.
Yeah, yeah, that's right. It's more.

Peter Wolf   20:55
30 minutes and go and build those things and preload them for the next several newsletters. So that's also not a problem, but that's good that you have something that's producing on a regular basis. Again, looking towards automating this whole thing, if we really get it to where we're comfortable and you we don't have to be.

Lem Quimpo   21:04
Yep.

Peter Wolf   21:11
Manually interfering and great, OK.

Lem Quimpo   21:13
Yep, that's right. Yep. And also, that's.
For the yeah for the EAN tools update, so I'm just also using like the GPT 40 search, but basically perplexity also I think because it's already finding good articles so I think it's already good. So I didn't update it for example this one.

Peter Wolf   21:38
And which one is this? This is ChatGPT doing this search?

Lem Quimpo   21:40
Yeah.
Yeah, this is the ChatGPT 40 search chip. That's right. But yeah, but basically you could also change this one to perplexity if you like. I I'm just not because I've tested it. It is actually like inputting good.

Peter Wolf   21:56
If it's coming up with good content, that's fine. I'm fine with using diversity.

Lem Quimpo   21:57
Yeah, good content. That's right. So yeah, it was. So I didn't change it, but for the links, I've changed it to perplexity because yeah, perplexity is much more, much more good on like a direct search, like a specific search of the link. So it was.

Peter Wolf   22:14
But so you're saying for our internal search for our internal website or or posts?

Lem Quimpo   22:19
Yep, that's right. Yeah, that's right. So.

Peter Wolf   22:22
So you're using a perplexity search that says search for Sarala blog posts or something.

Lem Quimpo   22:27
Yeah, that's right because we have here like like the create summary from the blog post link and then what will happen here is we also talked about yesterday with Bart like the like Serrala is like just adding links like every two weeks I think so the manual.

Peter Wolf   22:33
Huh.
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   22:45
Yeah, well, hopefully. So Peter, so Peter, like for for the section where it's going through kind of like our Serrala past stuff, I just thought it was easier to just get everything pulled from the Internet that we have because.

Peter Wolf   22:46
Well, we.

Lem Quimpo   22:46
Yeah, like the.
Yeah, so.

Bartosz Borek   23:01
The problem is, is when you when you go into our content and you click on you know Treasury Services or whatever, then it still leaves you at the same like link. It's not you couldn't really differentiate so to build a program.

Lem Quimpo   23:01
Yep.

Peter Wolf   23:16
OK, so you can't capture that. You can't capture the individual links.

Bartosz Borek   23:18
Yeah, to build a program, yeah, to actually capture just the treasury stuff because we didn't want like the FS2 stuff and you know, some of the AP, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   23:22
Yep.

Peter Wolf   23:29
Yeah, of course. But so hold on. So let me just make sure I'm clear in this model. And the reason we have the create summary for blog posts is we're going and finding the individual site of ours, our blog post, our information. We're plugging it in here, so we're filling in the.

Lem Quimpo   23:40
Yep, that's right.

Bartosz Borek   23:44
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   23:44
The the column C and are we filling in A&B or is that getting filled in after?

Lem Quimpo   23:44
Yep.

Bartosz Borek   23:46
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   23:46
Yeah, that's right.

Bartosz Borek   23:49
No, just just see, right, Lem? Just see. Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   23:50
No, just just the C Yep, that's right. The C Yep.

Peter Wolf   23:52
So we fill in C and this also I don't know if this is in that process. I I skimmed your process stuff. Len looks great, but just like for example in this do we define how to use this this workbook? Because I think here's like a would be great for adding in that standard operating.

Bartosz Borek   23:55
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   24:00
OK.

Peter Wolf   24:12
Seizure say on this tab SDS blog post, what you do is fill in column C, you click on column F and it will fill in the rest of the information right?

Lem Quimpo   24:18
Column. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah. In the SOP, it's. Yeah, it.

Bartosz Borek   24:21
Yeah, this is new. We just, we just came up with this yesterday. This was kind of our idea when we talked through that, you know, to have something like this. So Len built this. So I'm sure, I mean, but.

Bryan Wolf   24:25
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   24:26
OK.

Lem Quimpo   24:27
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   24:28
Good.
Perfect.

Lem Quimpo   24:30
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   24:32
OK, so no, I like this. So now we preload in whatever content is. We just choose whichever ones we want to pick, right? That's that's great. That's perfect, right? We're in control of this, but not an issue.

Lem Quimpo   24:34
Because, yeah, we.
Yep, that that's right. Yeah, that's right.

Bartosz Borek   24:40
And then Lem.

Lem Quimpo   24:42
Yes.

Bartosz Borek   24:43
Lem, you said that it's gonna randomly pick something off this list every time or?

Lem Quimpo   24:48
No, no, we we're manually because how the system works is we're actually choosing manually the content that we were with. Yep. So yeah, we could just.

Bartosz Borek   24:55
Oh, we're choosing. OK, so we're choosing manually here. OK, I thought you said something that I thought you said something yesterday that it would be picked at random from a list.

Lem Quimpo   25:04
I think that was.

Bartosz Borek   25:09
Maybe that was something else. Sorry. So yeah, maybe I'm I I have that confused with something else, but but yeah, Peter, so that.

Lem Quimpo   25:10
But yeah, this was something else. But yeah, but basically.

Peter Wolf   25:14
So I guess I guess just I would also make sure this is part of that standard operating procedure.
And maybe we could do a maybe, maybe it's maybe I'm overcomplicating it, but essentially we need to go to each one of these tabs and select what we want in the newsletter each each week or twice per week or whatever, right? Each of these tabs has a selection criteria requirement.

Lem Quimpo   25:40
Uh, for um, what?

Peter Wolf   25:43
So when it comes time to do the newsletter, I'm going to go to each one of these tabs. Someone's going to go to each one of these tabs and say this is what I'm putting in the next newsletter. Each tab has a selection criteria, right? So all you do is walk across the tabs and say, Yep, here's the ones I want for this week.

Lem Quimpo   25:46
OK.
Yep, that's right. Yep.
Yes.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   26:02
And and then execute right?

Lem Quimpo   26:04
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I actually added it also on the SOP. So we have there like a how it works and like a a tutorial on how to do the like the system flow or like the front end. So basically this is like our front end, right? Like the user interface.

Peter Wolf   26:11
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   26:23
Up to the last point which is the newsletter drafts to send the link to send the campaign and also like finalize push test e-mail. So yeah, I I've added it on also on the SOP documentation and yeah so basically.
It's also there. Um.
And yeah, I think, uh, that's it. And.
So yeah, basically we also talk about the like the overviews. So we didn't add here like the relevance because it's already like a Serrala post, right. So this is just like the summary overview of the article and also for the upcoming events. So that's just like an overview also of the.

Bartosz Borek   26:51
Um, we.
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   27:10
Like the upcoming event.

Peter Wolf   27:11
Do we need? Do we? Can we scroll up a little bit? Hold on, go to the the blogs one, right? No, no blogs. The the Serrala blogs. STS blogs, right? OK, so the header section is called what we need to change the the the visual. Nancy had given me a couple.

Lem Quimpo   27:16
OK.
Oh, right. Uh, this one. OK.
Mm.
Yeah, this one.

Peter Wolf   27:30
Things, but they're not finalized. So that means we're not going to have that to figure that out. So Serrala Daily Insights. So ISO 22, the catalyst for future ready Treasury. OK, Estee Lauder unifies Global Treasury with Serrala SAP Power.

Lem Quimpo   27:35
OK.

Peter Wolf   27:49
OK, hidden cost of cash pooling while intercompany accounting is.

Lem Quimpo   27:55
OK.

Peter Wolf   27:55
There we go. Cash.
OK. So we don't need a, I was wondering whether we needed some introduction to this. I mean I think it's, I think it it should given that these are very specific to the domain we're interested in and where our clientele is interested in, it should speak for itself, right?

Lem Quimpo   28:13
Yep.

Peter Wolf   28:16
So go back up a second and go up to the the the social media, social media.

Lem Quimpo   28:16
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   28:26
Social media. We we have some. No, we don't. We just say trending on social media. OK, great. So we don't have a blurb there wasting time either. Go down the next one.

Lem Quimpo   28:27
Um.
Yep.
Uh.
So productivity.

Peter Wolf   28:38
Productivity, AI tools and updates.
OK.
OK. I think that's good. Go down. Prompted the day. Yeah. Coverture's look like a management prompted. Yeah. OK, next. And this is our section, right? Survival daily insights. OK, next.

Lem Quimpo   29:01
Yep, that's right.
Coming events.

Peter Wolf   29:07
So upcoming events. And you're drawing this from our website, was it?

Bartosz Borek   29:09
This.

Lem Quimpo   29:14
Yeah, that's right. So when we click, click the link, it's actually going to your events. So this one, Serrala August form, then we have perplexity is like summarizing and giving an overview on this one. So when we also go back to the other ones, so for example this one.

Bartosz Borek   29:15
This is wait.

Lem Quimpo   29:34
So it will go back again to this the another event, so the Gartner event. So Yep.

Bartosz Borek   29:43
Hey, um, so.

Lem Quimpo   29:43
Uh.

Peter Wolf   29:43
OK. So in every case, they're all ones that our marketing team has formalized and has a landing page on.

Lem Quimpo   29:50
Yeah, So what happens here also is we're actually manually inputting here the events because yeah, it's not scraping the your website, but because we also discussed it yesterday that it's not efficient to like scrape the like your website and.

Bartosz Borek   29:55
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   29:56
OK.

Lem Quimpo   30:09
Just get the events because you're not updating it like every day. So it's much better I think. And of course most cost effective if we could just choose the like the links from your events for example here right whenever you update your event here for example there's a new.

Peter Wolf   30:11
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   30:28
There's a new update or for example this one. So this is still not on the not on the spreadsheet, so we could just copy this link.

Peter Wolf   30:38
Yeah, I mean, but that's also in 2026. I don't think we need to be posting about that now. I don't know how frequently they update this. My experience in looking at this is they did a ****** job at this, right? And so I don't know that we're gonna get all that much content here. And also when we.

Lem Quimpo   30:41
Yep.
Yeah, that's right.

Bartosz Borek   30:50
Yeah, yeah, we.

Lem Quimpo   30:50
OK.

Peter Wolf   30:55
I think the problem is when we are talking about upcoming events, I think we're going to be also talking about like our our webinars, for example, the landing page of our webinar. So would we be able to do that even though it's not listed as an or I guess it would be the same thing, it's got to.

Lem Quimpo   31:00
Uh.

Bartosz Borek   31:09
Yeah, because we just manually, we would just manually add the thing, right. So we we were, we were brainstorming yesterday and we I I had no idea because you know, even if we scraped it, a lot of these things that they have on the website really aren't even going to be beneficial to our STS practice.

Lem Quimpo   31:12
Yeah, it's. Yeah, that's right. It's manually researching, researching the.

Peter Wolf   31:26
That to us. Yep. Yep.

Lem Quimpo   31:28
Yep.

Bartosz Borek   31:28
Yeah. So I was thinking like, hey, we just, it's probably better to just have this manual. I mean, Lem was asking me questions yesterday about, you know, an upcoming, some upcoming booth thing that we have. And he's like, is this in Austin? I was like, I gotta be honest with you, I have no idea what this is even. So like.

Peter Wolf   31:44
Yeah, OK. But so if we have like we know, I think this is where we're promoting hopefully webinars and stuff like that, right? Or if we're gonna go to AFP or if we're gonna go to some other conference for us.

Lem Quimpo   31:44
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   31:45
I'm not.
Yeah, stuff like that, yeah.

Peter Wolf   32:00
But if if there's no landing page, then obviously it doesn't have anything to scrape. Uh.
We'd have to figure out how to deal with that.

Bartosz Borek   32:10
Well, couldn't we also, if there is like some SAP conference that we're attending, couldn't we just?

Peter Wolf   32:19
Write something.

Bartosz Borek   32:19
Get the link. Yeah, or no. Yeah, not not only that, but get the link from that conference and put it in there. So it's not necessarily a sorala.com page, but like an SAP.

Peter Wolf   32:27
Yeah, yeah. But we probably want to add something saying that we're, you know, that we're gonna be attending or something like that. But yeah.

Bartosz Borek   32:32
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   32:35
Oh, OK, yeah, it's actually, yeah, like another link here with the, for example, the conference website of the conference, something like that. And then.

Bartosz Borek   32:36
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I I mean, I just, I don't know how to automate this stuff because it's like, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   32:48
Yeah, yeah. But basically it's just the perplexity is just researching the link. So if you put here like an event link that Serrala is attending, so of course it would be, it would it should have.

Peter Wolf   32:54
Mhm.
It's just gonna write it based on we put AFP. It's gonna write a a summary on AFP, right? So but we could we could just we could also edit or whatever. I I don't know. OK.

Lem Quimpo   33:07
Yeah, something like that. Yep. Yep.
Yeah, you could. You could also edit the, of course, the uh.

Bartosz Borek   33:14
Yes.

Peter Wolf   33:16
Because that's that's what it's writing right there. That's what it's going to include, right? And we can just add it, right? Hey, we'll be attending Surat, the summit or AFP. Yeah. OK, good. That's good enough. And that way works fine, right? Because you can just put a generic AFP upcoming event and.

Lem Quimpo   33:19
Yep, that's right. Yeah, this is the Yep.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   33:34
Plugged in, uh, an extra sentence says we're gonna be there. Let us know if you're gonna be there, right? Something like that.

Lem Quimpo   33:39
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Like you could just manually put a simple, yeah, a simple overview and then Yep, yeah. So I think and then and last the the conclusion. So we're also feeding all of the.

Peter Wolf   33:45
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   33:55
Like the content of the newsletter for this one and then it's creating the conclusion also based together with the persona so.

Peter Wolf   34:06
I wonder if we think about this from the perspective, Bart, of of the of the webinars, if we're doing it where we're not promoting it in advance, but we're doing it after the fact like we're doing right now, right? This first one for sure we're saying.

Lem Quimpo   34:07
Uh.
It's just only.

Peter Wolf   34:21
We're not even going to post it until we have the webinar. And so where would we see that going? Would that go under blogs at that point and it's kind of treated like A blog? Yeah, that makes sense because it's not specifically saying it's a blog. It says insights of the day, right?

Lem Quimpo   34:30
OK.

Bartosz Borek   34:31
I think probably, right? Probably.
Exactly. Yeah. It's our content, right? It's all the daily insights, so.

Lem Quimpo   34:41
Yeah, sure. I'll do the inside.

Peter Wolf   34:42
Yeah.
OK. That's that's good. Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   34:53
Um.

Bartosz Borek   34:53
So when all the changes we talked about yesterday are in, right?

Lem Quimpo   34:57
Yeah, I've incorporated all of the, especially the prompts. So the prompts here are already updated to the one that yeah has, especially this one.

Bartosz Borek   34:59
OK, cool.
OK.

Peter Wolf   35:07
Stop right there. Just stay one, stay one second. Let me just see it.

Lem Quimpo   35:10
OK.

Peter Wolf   35:22
OK, great. So what we're where does the highlighting come from in the italics? Is that is that us telling? No, no, not there in the body where we turn it to blue and it's slightly italics. Yeah. Are we telling it in the prompt saying kind of grab the key concept and and highlight it the the relevance or something?

Lem Quimpo   35:24
Yeah.
Uh, this one.
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's right. That's right. It's we're telling ChatGPT to highlight the like a phrase or a sentence on the blurbs. So that's why there's like highlights here. Also, yeah, for example this one.

Peter Wolf   35:49
Yep.
OK, I like that. Yep.
Same opportunity. Yep, I like that. Looks good.

Lem Quimpo   35:56
Yeah. So, yeah, every time, yeah.
And then also I want to note that the images here are all coming from Unsplash. So because perplexity doesn't have like like the image, it can't get the like the image URL. So what I did here on.

Peter Wolf   36:02
Awesome.

Bryan Wolf   36:09
OK, great.

Peter Wolf   36:15
Hold on, hold on. Which one can't get the image perplexity? So these are all developed images from that extra step we have.

Lem Quimpo   36:18
Yeah, that perplexity so.
Yeah, that's right. But what I did is I I have actually updated it and added a step which is image keyword. So what what's happening here is check GPT is we're feeding like the the like the section.
Like the news article to Chat GPD like the title and the summary coming from perplexity and then it's it is like creating like a phrase two to three word phrase keyword. So that's the one that we are feeding here. So this is actually not static anymore.

Peter Wolf   36:47
Yep, Yep.
So you're getting something that hopefully is closer to an image that seems relevant.

Lem Quimpo   37:02
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Because if we put here like a static last time, right, we were putting just a business, business, yeah, business word. So it's just getting like no context or yeah, generic one. So this one we have now like, yeah, depending on the phrase.

Peter Wolf   37:20
Good.

Lem Quimpo   37:21
Also, so it's searching Unsplash for that particular image.

Peter Wolf   37:25
So question for you. Again, I only just scanned the documentation you put together, so I'm interviewing people now for taking these flows and putting them into the Microsoft environment with Microsoft Power Automate, Power Connect and.

Lem Quimpo   37:36
OK.

Peter Wolf   37:41
Compile studio and I'm just trying to think about how what's going to be effective and efficient way to do this because there's so much information in the steps. It's not just the steps themselves, it's all the information inside the steps. Now in the documentation that I saw you at the again, I only scanned it, but.

Lem Quimpo   37:43
OK.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   38:00
In that documentation, it seemed like you scraped some of the content out of those individual steps, but certainly not all of the content, right?

Lem Quimpo   38:09
Yeah, what I'm thinking also is, for example, let me just go back to the.
For example here on the newsletter process flow. So when or it's a different one for example this one. So I've I've actually explained it so that like it would.
Have like an overview of the like step by step. Of course we could add here like an image also of the like of the automation but I I didn't explain like the like the for example this one like.
Uh, I've added the like manual mappings here because per uh it would be different per platform, so I think the much better.

Peter Wolf   39:04
Right. But if someone has to take the content from this platform, put it into another platform, they're either gonna need access to these flows and be able to drill into them and capture the information, or we're gonna need to extract the information and put it.

Lem Quimpo   39:15
Yep, that's right. Yeah.
Yeah, but yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   39:19
How difficult would be? Would it be? Because it seems like when you click into these, some of these are like 5-6 layers down where you have the actual content. Is there some way to extract the the underlying content and and consolidate that?

Lem Quimpo   39:27
Uh.
Yeah.
Uh, Co content. Um, what? What particular?

Peter Wolf   39:38
The content for each like take a step, take the step for the ChatGPT where the tag three articles, right? Or choose three articles. So right here like to even you'd have to Scroll down even on this. You can't even just screenshot this right? It's each layer opens up, opens up, opens up.

Lem Quimpo   39:44
OK.

Peter Wolf   39:56
Is there any way to have it say take all the content from this step and extract it? Is there something that does that?

Lem Quimpo   39:56
Alright, right. Yeah, that's right.
No, not really. So we what we can do is like copy the prompts on all the chat GPTS and then yeah, I could add like the prompts here. So I was assuming like the developer would like check of course check.
The automation and then he will just check also like the prompts and then just copy paste it.
Uh, yeah.
Uh, yeah.

Peter Wolf   40:40
Unless I'm paying, you know, some unbelievable rate, then I'm not gonna be able to pay.
So having somebody who's going to be fluid and flexible in this and being able to drill into this and be able to interpret these and and then take them over somewhere else is going to be challenging. And I'm also just interested from my perspective of how, how would if I was a consultant, right?

Lem Quimpo   40:49
Yeah.
Yeah, and um.
I'm.

Peter Wolf   41:06
I think about our projects. We have these configuration workbooks. When we go into a client, we have all the tables that we configure and we put all the steps in. We put all the content in. They have documentation showing every bit of setup.

Lem Quimpo   41:06
OK.

Peter Wolf   41:21
That exists in the system, all the settings, every flag, every check mark, every box, and it feels like there's no way to do that here. It seems like you have to go in at the granular level and only can look at it within this context right there, that context. There's no way to extract this.

Lem Quimpo   41:27
OK.
Uh.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. Yep, just a screenshot I think or like copy pasting. But if your developer is also like proficient on Jason code, so.
He can also check actually like the.

Peter Wolf   41:54
Does the Jason code get every one of the pieces out of there? It does, right? Because that's what you hand over to Bryan. That's what you're handing over. And that has all the settings, all the content in there.

Bryan Wolf   41:58
Yeah, it does.

Lem Quimpo   41:58
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   42:01
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   42:01
Yeah, so did you?

Bryan Wolf   42:06
Everything, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   42:06
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So everything is actually here. So basically what we are doing in make is just like visualizing the Jason code, but all of the system here is actually found here on the Jason code. So if the developer is like proficient on.

Bryan Wolf   42:15
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   42:22
Like reading like a raw Jason code. So I think he will also understand like the flow of the like the system. So as you can see, yeah it's.
Even the prompts is also here. Let me yeah this one as you can see the prompt is actually here also. So the prompt this is the prompt for ChatGPT. So the model is GPT 4.1.

Peter Wolf   42:38
Yeah.
So for us, like Bart, this is like reading the BAI file or XML file, right? If you if you know how to look at it, you see you can see the information, but if you don't, you're like, Jesus, this is just a bunch of letters and slashes and dots and whatever, right?

Bartosz Borek   42:49
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   42:51
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Um.

Peter Wolf   43:00
OK, but this you couldn't take this and load this into Microsoft. I wonder actually, now that I think about it, could you run this through Chat GPD and say, hey, I want to do this in in Microsoft in a Microsoft Power Automate domain?

Lem Quimpo   43:18
I'm not sure. Also maybe Claude can like handle that kind of and then maybe just.

Peter Wolf   43:19
How would I convert this in a Microsoft Power Automate domain?
Can you do me a favor? Can you again send me because this this workflow is 1 flow inside the newsletter, which is 10 different steps, right? Or nine steps?

Lem Quimpo   43:37
Yeah, that's right. Nine steps. So this for this one, this is actually this one. So this particular flow is this one. So this is just one of the like the flows on. That's right.

Peter Wolf   43:44
Yeah.
Yeah. Can you pull up the the documentation you created and show me? So does it say the newsletter is 9 flows and here's the nine different flows or how do you approach it in the in the documentation?

Lem Quimpo   43:55
OK.
Yeah, I I've I added every flow so we have here like the how it works. So this is like the front end and then I also explained the back end here. So the back end is explaining for every step.

Peter Wolf   44:11
OK, so there's the inner reader one, content aggregator two. OK.

Lem Quimpo   44:14
Yep, Yep. And then content formatter. So these are all the same naming convention also with the with the like the flows and then OK.

Peter Wolf   44:27
So let me ask you, Lem, when you created this, I'm assuming you leveraged Chat EBT or some other AI to to put this into a structure. Did you use the Jason file and say what?

Lem Quimpo   44:34
No, no, not no. I I actually manually created this one so I was like cross referencing this one one by one. So I didn't. Yeah I I didn't like feed the whole Jason. So I tried that already on the past and like chat GPD just like mess it up and.

Bryan Wolf   44:42
Oh.
OK.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   44:53
And can't handle like the step by step and like the logic because we have also like the logic for example this aggregate data. So what's the logic behind or what this does and just to also share.
The thing is if you are like building this one right on like a different platform. So the most important thing there would be like the steps and like the logic, not really the like the intricacies here because for every platform for example when we use N8N it would be like a whole different environment so they they have.

Peter Wolf   45:15
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   45:29
Like they have a different style for, for example, searching a row. Yeah, that's right. So I think the most important thing is like understanding like understanding the what's the goal, like for example the first step up to the seven steps, so.

Peter Wolf   45:32
Yeah, a different approach, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   45:45
I think it would be not really helpful if we can if we would for example like add the variable here and then like list the variable.

Peter Wolf   45:52
Well, I don't know. Why wouldn't? Wouldn't the variables be important? It's like, OK, this is what we use as variables in one. And then later on I pull those variables in back somewhere else. I mean, aren't they going to need to know that? Because we then use those variables somewhere else, right often.

Lem Quimpo   46:00
Yep.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So yeah, how I did is, how I did it is I've.

Bartosz Borek   46:12
So.

Lem Quimpo   46:14
Explained it as an aggregation of data, so like more broadly speaking and not for example like the because for example N8N doesn't work like this on the the aggregating data because all of the data there are already an array. So I think.
Yeah, I'm not sure if like it would, but yeah, basically we could also put like the like the more intricacies, for example the iteration. I because what I'm also thinking is like.
The data manipulation for every platform is like really the same. So when you build this one in power automate or like for example any and you won't be using like aggregate data or it would be for example like a loop.

Peter Wolf   47:02
Some other function that they have.

Lem Quimpo   47:04
Yeah, that's right. So the most important thing is what's the logic behind the step. So that's how I approach.

Peter Wolf   47:09
And so this is where someone who's an expert in that field would say, oh, OK, well, I don't, I don't use aggregate data. I got this other function that we utilize here.

Lem Quimpo   47:16
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So yeah, when when he already understands that from I know reader, I would need to get all the data to feed it to. So the like the thought process of the developer there would be like how to do that one, like how to do the process, not really like.
How to like aggregate something? So it would be like a different step, but the like the logic would be yeah, the logic is much more important. That's why I explained it like just in plain language to make it also like simpler, like the logic simpler.

Peter Wolf   47:38
Yeah.
OK. But I think for sure we should have, if there are specific prompts we're using, I think the prompts should be included in that documentation at least, right? Because then that's transferable. We would need to use those, right?

Lem Quimpo   47:52
So, uh, yeah.
Yeah, we yeah, that's right. We could also, yeah, add add the ChatGPT prompts here on the. I'll just update it for example here on like I know reader RSS. So I'll add here at the bottom the prompt for.
Uh, choose top free articles and then also like for the uh.
Format to Jason. Yeah so for example this one like this is just formatting the data to Jason, but in other platforms we won't be needing this one like chat. There is already like for example an end it and there is a node that parses out the data to a structure.
Sure. So that is, yeah, for example that that's, yeah, how do they explain it? Yeah, basically that one. So I'm not sure if, but yeah, basically I could also add all of the prompts we used, but yeah, it would be I think important for the like the.
Plexity, the claw, like the creation of the content, I think. Uh yeah, it's uh good that we could add it here also on the.

Peter Wolf   49:09
I think for sure at least the creation of content we need to be including the prompts that we're using, right. So clear reference to what we ultimately got, ultimately got us to where we wanted to go, right. We again we might tweak them in the future and if we're if we're if we're attaching a document and I mean we just.

Lem Quimpo   49:13
Yeah.
Yeah, here.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   49:28
You know, where we're pulling a persona that we need to say, OK, well, here, here was the sample or here's the persona or, you know, here is where we're capturing an external document and incorporating A persona. I mean, it needs to be clear that we're supplementing there, right?

Lem Quimpo   49:42
Yep.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. So yeah, I think I I could add like links and stuff. Yeah, basically what I did here is I was also assuming that like the one that it would build to the other platforms, it would check because.
That is how how I also do for example when someone like like my client wants me to like review the automation like the troubleshoot something. So I also check the nodes 1 by 1 so.
I think that would also help the developer on like also on the flows together with the like the document. But yeah, I'll I'll add the.

Peter Wolf   50:28
And I I think too, even though it may be very, it may be very difficult to do because it's so that it's just one long string, which makes it, um, challenging. But I really feel like we should be trying to screenshot the visual of this too.

Lem Quimpo   50:40
Oh.
Yeah, yeah, I think that would also help. Um.

Peter Wolf   50:44
I just think that helps Orient people, right? Now I saw before you took it instead of, for example, if we wanted to make it narrower, you could push that exactly right. You could do that. I think we need this in there. We need this because that's a visual to Orient you to what we've built, right?

Lem Quimpo   50:52
Yep. Like, for example, yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah, I uh.
Yep.
Yeah, that's right. And then also the, I think the.

Peter Wolf   51:04
And I know in some where we use the AI agent, it's a black box, so it doesn't really give you that much, but I think this at least helps Orient.

Lem Quimpo   51:10
Yep.
Yeah, I think, yeah, definitely this would help. And also like the naming conventions here I think would help because we were also discussing last time, right, that like a mermaid chart. So we won't be needing a mermaid chart here because we already have like a naming convention on what's happening. So for example, this is just from left to right and then like.

Peter Wolf   51:18
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yep, Yep. But this is this is definitely important. If you're going to again, we need either this or something like a mermaid shark to show the flow. But if we can do this and you can structure it like that to make it narrower and tall so it can fit onto a page, I think we need these screenshotted and incorporated.

Lem Quimpo   51:33
Get articles from IN reader. So yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   51:51
Read it into the document for sure.

Lem Quimpo   51:53
Yep. OK. Yeah, we'll we'll do that. Yeah. I think that would, yeah, really help also like the developer on on, yeah, getting more context. Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   51:54
OK.

Lem Quimpo   52:07
OK. And then.
Yep.
Just.
Yeah, I think we can do.
Something like this.

Peter Wolf   52:34
Yeah, right. Rows of four or five. Yeah, that that's good. That that makes, that makes it work. And you can cut that and paste that into the document and that will be, that will be much a great help to Orient someone.

Lem Quimpo   52:37
Yeah, yeah. And then.
Yeah.
Yes.

Peter Wolf   52:51
At least for me, visually, it makes it much more understandable, right? Or to then follow whatever's written. OK, great. So you'll you'll proceed with that, right?

Lem Quimpo   52:51
Yeah, I think so.
Yeah, that's right.
OK, yeah, I'll update the documentation also. OK.

Peter Wolf   53:05
Yep, perfect. Then. So let's let's go back now to the newsletter. What do we need to be done?
What do we need to be done?

Lem Quimpo   53:15
Oh.
The I think the I know.

Peter Wolf   53:17
Brian needs to move it into our environment and then and.

Lem Quimpo   53:20
Yep, then.

Bryan Wolf   53:22
I have it basically in our environment. I just needed to like add a couple of things, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   53:24
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   53:25
Whatever tweaks he's made, yeah. OK, so whatever updates to the to the prompts then.

Lem Quimpo   53:26
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   53:29
OK.

Lem Quimpo   53:31
And the the I know reader also if you uh because uh this I was just using my like I reader that's why I didn't add it here but.

Peter Wolf   53:39
Yes. So Brian, did we, did we update the the idle reader? Have we added those custom?

Bryan Wolf   53:46
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I added something. Sorry, I was like on the background, but yes, I I did. But he's his perplexity thing. I I would have to implement that because I don't have that. I was pulling. Mine's pulling straight from. I know reader.

Lem Quimpo   53:52
OK.

Peter Wolf   53:59
Right. Perplexity is the one we did yesterday. We walked through that we were adding. So he's now added that. We need to incorporate that, right?

Lem Quimpo   54:04
Yep.
Yep, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   54:07
Uh, yes.

Peter Wolf   54:08
And then then we said on the on the Twitter, not on. Well, let's go with the first with the first with the LinkedIn is is the LinkedIn selection of accounts inside one of these, one of these.

Lem Quimpo   54:10
Yeah.
Yeah, the LinkedIn.

Peter Wolf   54:28
Oh, items or is it inside of the? OK, so it's.

Lem Quimpo   54:29
Yeah.
It's inside. Yep, that's right. So a.

Peter Wolf   54:34
Can you cut and paste those and and send those out in the chat? And then on the Twitter we're saying we don't have, we don't have anything right now. So LinkedIn and we said we're finding the Twitter to be, I mean the LinkedIn to be better, but let me, I want to, I want to search the.

Lem Quimpo   54:46
Yeah, on Twitter. Uh.

Peter Wolf   54:54
the search I did yesterday. I have some names of accounts that I think do speak to this topic, this combination. Even it's not like every one of their articles or items has to be the combination of finance and and technology. We want that to be the greater

Lem Quimpo   55:11
OK.

Peter Wolf   55:14
Trend of topics, but sometimes just straight finance discussion, right? Treasury, corporate treasury, corporate finance, that's OK too. So I will. I'll take a look at accounts there, but send me the ones for that you have already identified for LinkedIn.

Lem Quimpo   55:24
Oh, OK.
Yep. Uh.
Yeah, uh, this one.
And I I I actually like filtered this out already because this is much more like longer list, but the other ones were already not active. Like they they they posted. Yeah, like Yep.

Peter Wolf   55:42
OK.
That's fine. I I just want to, I just want to see what you have in there. This is also this definitely needs to go in that documentation as well to show that we've had to go and curate a list of selection accounts, right?

Lem Quimpo   55:52
Yeah, the on. Yeah, that's right. On aptify. Yep, that's right.
Oh.
OK.
Disable, yeah, disable this one.

Peter Wolf   56:12
Yeah. And you know what, Lem? It may be that you take a picture at this level where you really can't necessarily see all the words, and then you go down into the individual flow. So there's an overview that someone could see. They might not be able to read and interpret everything, but they at least then have orientation.
And then if you go into an individual flow, if it had like the bottom flow, right, that's 368. And then you could take that and kind of, yeah, isolate it and then just pull that particular flow to try and make it fit better, right?

Lem Quimpo   56:28
OK.
Yeah, like that. Like that, Yeah.
Yep, yeah, zoom in.
OK.
Yep, yeah, I think yeah, because this one it's not readable already. Like the naming conventions are not readable. But for this one I think I'm I didn't delete yet like the Reddit scraper. So let me know if I think I'm.

Peter Wolf   56:57
Yeah, you can take that out. We can take the red scraper out.

Lem Quimpo   56:59
Yeah, I'll we can, yeah, take this out and then also the three the viral prompts. So I'll take this out also or yeah, OK.

Peter Wolf   57:08
Yeah.
That'll simplify it.

Lem Quimpo   57:13
Yep, so this one's already good. Yeah, the mission.

Peter Wolf   57:19
So now if you pull this, if you pull those two middle ones closer together, right? And now do a wrap on the bottom one, you know what I mean? No, no, like the bottom one like you did before. Why are you unlinking them?

Lem Quimpo   57:24
Yep.
Um.
You could also do like so that it's much easier. For example this one like that or.

Peter Wolf   57:38
Well, no, I meant. I meant, you know how you did the rap, how you took three, take that and put it back on the bottom again.

Lem Quimpo   57:42
Oh, OK. Yeah. Yeah.
Uh uh, this one.

Peter Wolf   57:48
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   57:50
OK.

Peter Wolf   57:52
OK, so now do grab those four to. Yeah, exactly right. And now if you could do that on the top one as well.

Lem Quimpo   57:53
And then like, uh, for example, yeah, like that.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   58:01
Can you scooch them down? Yeah, exactly.

Lem Quimpo   58:04
Yep, Yep. And then like, zoom in, right? Zoom in for. Yeah, like, for example, this one. Yep. And then this one and then this one. OK.

Peter Wolf   58:11
Yeah, right, right.
Yep, exactly, exactly right. So take an overview picture that gives us the full view and then and then drill in so you can see the details better. But I think that works very well, right?

Lem Quimpo   58:19
Yep.
Yeah.
OK. Yep. Yeah. And I think that would also give more context really and and then.

Peter Wolf   58:29
Awesome.
OK, so again back to the other question, what, what, what is, what do we need to finish on the newsletter for this week? We need, we need, we we preferably we need to change the visual that's on the two sections at the bottom that currently just have our generic.

Lem Quimpo   58:54
Yeah, this one. Yep, this one and this one.

Peter Wolf   58:55
Have our generic, yeah, so so those images.
Images.
Um, for Serrala blogs or insights and upcoming events, right? Upcoming.

Lem Quimpo   59:10
Coming events.
I.

Peter Wolf   59:14
And what what do we have in that upcoming events right now? I mean, maybe we leave the upcoming events off for now.

Lem Quimpo   59:18
Uh.

Peter Wolf   59:21
Hold on. What's the date? What's the date of that? So CRF. What's CRF? I don't even know. Yeah, I don't even know what that is.

Lem Quimpo   59:21
OK, uh, we have just.
The this one.
This one, August Farm and Expo, August 18 to 20.

Peter Wolf   59:35
Yeah, but what is it? They don't even have the name like we're supposed to know what CRF is. I guess people who are going to CRF know what it is.

Lem Quimpo   59:36
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   59:40
It's credit something. It's the credit something credit. Um.

Peter Wolf   59:43
Credit and risk, credit risk forum or something.

Bryan Wolf   59:47
Yeah, that's part. What was that thing called that we looked at yesterday that we we like we wasn't there, but it was even it's credits on them.

Lem Quimpo   59:53
Oh yeah, it was. I think that was picking up in Austin, the credit risk forum, something like that. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   59:56
The same one that's over here, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:00:01
Yeah, OK. Um.

Bartosz Borek   1:00:02
Oh.

Peter Wolf   1:00:06
What is the CRF conference in Austin?

Lem Quimpo   1:00:07
And yeah.
Yeah, Gardner, CFO.

Peter Wolf   1:00:15
Right. Credit Research Foundation. So it's credit, credit and collections. That's your AR when somebody's not paying you, how do you and assessing companies and putting some risk level in them, how much credit you're going to give them?

Bryan Wolf   1:00:18
Yeah, that's it.

Lem Quimpo   1:00:42
Yep.
Yep, this one.

Peter Wolf   1:00:49
We just leave those two other ones for now. I think they're at least decent and uh.

Lem Quimpo   1:00:52
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:00:56
Yeah.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:01:00
Yeah, we could just remove it here on the yeah, 2026 I just actually.

Peter Wolf   1:01:04
I think there's one other thing we should probably fix. We should probably put one here and it should be fixed would be just a link to our main web, not our main Serrala website, but like our main STS website.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:05
Hmm.

Peter Wolf   1:01:21
Maybe that should always just be at the very bottom in the conclusion or something. It should just say if you're, you know, you wanna see more from STS, then here's here's the link, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:01:21
Uh.
Yeah.
OK, the the Seralla link, Seralla website or?

Bryan Wolf   1:01:35
What's the like?

Peter Wolf   1:01:37
Yeah, go to. What's our, what's our? Hold on, I'll pull it up. Let me see. Serrala STS branding.
So here's here's the link you should use or can use chat.

Lem Quimpo   1:02:06
Uh, Shruti Services.

Peter Wolf   1:02:08
Right, that's just our main, our main website for our practice.

Bartosz Borek   1:02:08
Yes.

Lem Quimpo   1:02:10
OK.

Bartosz Borek   1:02:11
Yep, mhm.

Lem Quimpo   1:02:16
OK.
Yep, this one, right?
And then what content would I be like?
I would just add the static. Uh, yes, I.

Peter Wolf   1:02:33
I would just say at the very bottom, I'd put it maybe a sentence if you you want to find more, you want to find more insights or more information about Treasury or yeah, let's come up. Bar can you just do a quick chat CBD come up with a sentence that kind of encapsulates?

Lem Quimpo   1:02:39
Yeah.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:02:51
If they want to find out more about anything related to what we do, here's the here's the link, right? Something like that.

Bartosz Borek   1:02:59
Yep. And that's in the conclusion, right?

Peter Wolf   1:03:01
Yeah, we just put at the very bottom right after it's separated, not like the last sentence. I put a return a space and then if you're interested in finding out any more information or finding finding other other insights we provide, here's a link to our site.

Lem Quimpo   1:03:07
Yeah, like uh.
OK, yeah, for another paragraph after the paragraph.

Peter Wolf   1:03:18
Something like that.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:20
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:03:22
Yeah, not. Well, I mean, I'm just, I'm thinking one sentence with the link, but separate it out from that paragraph. So let me see what this conclusion. The Treasury landscape is shifting fast. Real-time tools are democratizing Bitcoin, is entering corporate balance sheets and AI is automating everything from cash forecast and risk, whether you're evaluating mid-market.

Lem Quimpo   1:03:31
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:03:41
Solutions. We're navigating cryptocurrency strategies. The message is clear. Technology adoption isn't optional anymore. It's competitive advantage. Stay ahead of the trends or risk falling behind. Yeah, and then you just have the space then.
A sentence that says you want to find out additional information or more insights. Here's our website, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:03:57
Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:04:03
But here's I I would say our name out. Here's here's the Saral Treasury Services link to Saral Treasury Services. More insights or something like that.

Bartosz Borek   1:04:12
What about? What about something like this? So I like this. This is kind of clean typing it in here. Learn more about Sorella and how we support treasury and finance teams worldwide. Visit. That's good, right? Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:04:22
Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Love it. Love it. Yep. That's all I'm looking for is just a clear statement of how they can get to our other information that we we have more to offer. So based on that, I mean, this frigging looks clean, guys. This looks terrific.

Lem Quimpo   1:04:25
OK.

Bartosz Borek   1:04:29
Yep.

Lem Quimpo   1:04:33
OK.

Bartosz Borek   1:04:39
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:04:39
Let me just paste it here.

Peter Wolf   1:04:41
Yeah. OK. So the next thing is.

Bartosz Borek   1:04:43
So are you guys going to run a practice iteration tomorrow before we make it live on Friday or is that the goal?

Peter Wolf   1:04:50
Well, for well, we got a few things to keep us from going live. I need to get the list of names that's on our list. We need to get that extracted from.

Bartosz Borek   1:04:58
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:05:00
No.

Peter Wolf   1:05:02
From Mercado.

Bartosz Borek   1:05:04
Chris.
Chris, right. Oh, OK, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:05:07
Right to put into to put into the what is it called? Beehive. No, that was the other one we were gonna use. What are we using? Bravo.

Lem Quimpo   1:05:16
Yeah, Bravo. Bravo Company. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:05:18
That's the that's the campaign tool where we have to put the e-mail addresses in.

Lem Quimpo   1:05:24
Yeah, that's right. On the list here on Bravo on the contacts. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:05:31
Yeah, OK, so hold on. I need contact list.

Lem Quimpo   1:05:34
You could just, uh yeah, import the contacts from like a CSV file.

Peter Wolf   1:05:42
Yep. Bravo. OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:05:43
Uh.
Yeah, we can import from a CSV file here, text file or XLS.

Peter Wolf   1:05:53
OK.
OK, yeah, I don't see any reason we won't have this out, but we shouldn't have this out by Friday, right? The only thing is getting the list.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:06:14
Yep, the list. Um, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:06:16
Then then I think well the so next Step 2 or related to this because I think we should be able to use the content we've already included here is if updating the individual.
The individual article function, because the individual article function really was a component piece of of this, right? We just need the prompt, the appropriate prompt to say write the blog with the context of how many characters and I can.

Lem Quimpo   1:06:44
1.
2.

Peter Wolf   1:06:51
Can tell you that I in my prompt my I need to update my persona because I was telling it here's how many characters to use right? Which was the limit. But when you use when you do things like.

Lem Quimpo   1:07:04
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:07:09
Specifically, where I found the problem was if you use Unicode to make stuff bold in LinkedIn, that's the way you make it bold, right? You can't just highlight it and say bold. You have to write it in Unicode. When you do it in Unicode, it counts as two characters for each character you use. So if you do the header in bold.

Lem Quimpo   1:07:27
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   1:07:29
Then whatever the total number of characters is, you have to count that twice. Any other words you bold, any header sections, anything you bold, you have to count them twice. So I I know that I need to update the persona to to decrease the number of characters that it's thinking it can use and to take that into account, you know, say.

Lem Quimpo   1:07:33
Twice. Oh.

Peter Wolf   1:07:49
Create the header in Unicode and and and calculate those as double the value and then you know it's sure to reduce because it also has a tendency to to produce content that's longer than what I've asked for. And then you got to go back and say, oh, can you reduce the size and then you plug it in. It's like, oh, it's still 3 characters.
Character's too big. I've got to change it again. So it's better just to say, look, shorten by an extra 200 characters or something, right? And then count everything as double for Unicode. I think that stuff needs to be put into the prompt for LinkedIn posting specifically, but we should now be able to do that one.

Lem Quimpo   1:08:26
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:08:28
As well to bring that fully to fruition.

Lem Quimpo   1:08:30
Yeah, the LinkedIn one. That's right.

Peter Wolf   1:08:33
Yeah. So I'd like to, I'd like to bring that to fruition. So if you can work with Brian, get these all into our system, into our setup and and then.

Lem Quimpo   1:08:38
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:08:48
I'm going to go. I'll I'll do a search for LinkedIn and Twitter accounts to add to that. I'm trying to get in touch with marketing about image for the Surala insights and upcoming events. I don't know if that's going to happen or not.
And then the contact list also these are all related to marketing team. So I don't know how much success I'm going to have, but I will work on that.
Um.
So then what? Uh, let me just look at my calendar.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:33
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:09:35
Bad day.
OK.
OK. If you could plow forward with that. Hey Nick, what's your availability later this afternoon, say after two or even, well, Sran to the webinar, that's off the table now, so I don't even have that.
So I'm open. Yeah, I don't. And Nick, you know, no, definitely I don't not looking to create any conflicts for you. But what's your availability either later this afternoon or very early evening? I'm supposed to go out with Claire tonight, so.

Lem Quimpo   1:10:16
OK.
Oh.

Peter Wolf   1:10:22
I can't do later evening.

Nicholas Westburg   1:10:23
I have a meeting at one, I think 1:15 and then I'm free for the rest of the afternoon with with no other meetings.

Peter Wolf   1:10:30
Great. Why don't we plan to, why don't we plan to get together and we can go through, we can go through the talk about the the repository, right and what we have that content look at the.

Nicholas Westburg   1:10:44
Yeah.
Yeah, that works. Yep.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:11:03
OK, so then let's let's shoot for say.
I mean, you said 1:15, so let's shoot for maybe 2:30. Is that enough time? OK, all right, so I'll put up. I'll send out a meeting invite 2:30 and.

Nicholas Westburg   1:11:15
Yeah, that's perfect. Perfect.

Peter Wolf   1:11:26
Yep. OK, great. Anything else, guys? I mean, I know there's other stuff, but I got to jump to another call and but I think this is terrific. I'm really pleased to be getting one of these process flows really finalized. I think this is a great one. I I think this is.

Bartosz Borek   1:11:30
All right.

Peter Wolf   1:11:43
Good combination of functions, good combination process flow automations. Thank you. That's weird. Nice. I was trying to keep it skinny. Yeah, nice. OK, yeah, but that's, that's, let's, let's wrap this one up, get into our environment and then we'll move forward and.
And then obviously if you keep moving forward with the documentation, I'll get the the hopefully I'll get a developer in the next day and we can jump on that getting this stuff migrated over, OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:12:04
OK.
Yep, I'll update them. Uh, Yep.
OK, copy.

Peter Wolf   1:12:17
All right, thanks. And then we'll push forward on finalizing the rest of them, right? Again, updating documentation and finalizing them, getting, working out all the little kinks and really getting all these to productive ready.

Lem Quimpo   1:12:21
Yep.
Yeah, I I I.
OK yeah I actually already also like updated some of the like the past flows so the Jason files would be like different from your environment also because I've like added like Claude for the content and then I've added like the web hook triggers for for example like the research company.

Peter Wolf   1:12:42
Great. Those are things that you can work with Bryan to get updated in our environment as well, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:12:46
Yeah.
OK, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:12:50
So that we can then fine tune them and and make sure we're or I don't you know maybe maybe maybe that doesn't make sense. Maybe that sending that over and updating them right now doesn't make sense until we get into let's walk through each one and then say OK what is it we need to fine tune it to to make sure instead of doing another iteration.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:55
I wonder is uh what?

Lem Quimpo   1:13:07
Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:13:09
Where you send them to Brian, Brian updates. Then we have another Jason. We make some big changes and move other stuff. Let's take the ones now and let's work forward and finalize them and then migrate them, right. So this one to me.

Lem Quimpo   1:13:14
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:15
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:13:23
OK. Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:13:25
We're now in final tweak mode. Put that bottom stuff in the conclusion. I do think I'm gonna ultimately add a YouTube video selection too, because I think that that adds again another media, another format, but at the.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:26
Spokes in this month for for sure.

Peter Wolf   1:13:44
I don't know if we put that in the social media because that's where it was. That's where that's where superhuman minds puts it. Superhuman AI. Maybe we put that in the in the social media section because I did the same thing with perplexity.
And that's that we did with the articles and it came up with great stuff. Matter of fact, let me see if I have this still up here. Yeah, I just ran this right before we had the meeting. Let me.
Share.
And again, I did not spend time on writing this this. Can you guys see my screen?
All I did was provide links to the 10 most watched and talked about YouTube videos posted between July 15th and July 23rd. That would be interesting to corporate Treasury finance leaders that wanted to learn about the latest information, the intersection of corporate Treasury, finance, operations, digital transformation, optimization, AI and financial tech. Please exclude videos on.

Bartosz Borek   1:14:26
Yep.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:26
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:14:45
Investing in capital markets, investment strategies and related topics, because I read it once before and it came back with a lot of stuff like, hey, here's a great trading program and whatnot. So I just, yeah, I mean, investing is part of what we do in our space, but I'd say it's going to get more crap than it's going to bring value.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:49
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   1:15:05
So looking at here, it's like, yeah, examining impact of generative AI, accredited underwriting, financial inclusion, Agentic AI, process automation, successful digital transformation, people process, Treasury takeaways, podcast.
Anthropic launches, Cloud Financial AI to transform investment analysis, innovation, collaboration between banks and fintech. I mean, these are all, these are all great and these are all within the last, you know, seven days. So if we just said, OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:15:33
Yeah, that's good.

Peter Wolf   1:15:37
This one we wouldn't necessarily even have to run every day and say whenever we're going to or we could we just say run every day and pick you know the same thing as before pick like 3 and then we have a selection criteria where we get this. It's got the blurb summary and we.
We can do the same thing as we do with the articles and and we could include that, right? Or not even. We just stick with this because social media, we just stick with it being the same kind of summary approach that we did in social media. We don't actually put a commentary to it.

Lem Quimpo   1:16:09
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:16:11
But then this would be a video where someone could click right on because when I went to like this one, let me just say I think this is the one.
Oh, I don't know if you guys can hear this.
Can you guys hear that?

Bartosz Borek   1:16:30
No, he can't.

Lem Quimpo   1:16:30
No, not very.

Peter Wolf   1:16:31
OK, so it's like Claude just announced a financial AI solution. It's a game changer, blah blah blah. But I mean, this is, this is pretty decent. It's it's relatively short. It's only one minute, right? But I think that again having that other media approach to.
Inclusion. So I would say you know putting that at at the in the section. Um, hold on a second. Where is this?
Putting that.
Yeah, putting that like here at the top section say saves the first one. You know these this could stay the same, but say right under trendy on social this week. Then you could have a YouTube video as the first thing with the same kind of blurb underneath it and then you have the rest of them or something.

Lem Quimpo   1:17:28
OK, the I mean the OK.

Peter Wolf   1:17:30
So I'm not going to do that right now. I want to get this one out this week and and I don't want to, I don't want to disrupt this more. But I think doing that is not far off from what we already do, right? I don't think we're we're really materially changing things. We just have another spot to say YouTube videos and we'll just pick one per week.
Can include it now. The other thing is I guess length, right?
How long is this getting? Does that? Yeah. All right, great. Well, we'll talk to you later on. Thanks, Nick.

Nicholas Westburg   1:17:57
Hey guys, I got a jet.
Thank you. Yep. Say bye.

Peter Wolf   1:18:06
Does this feel like it's?
Too long. I'm looking to you, Bart, to try and get your gauge your assessment here.
You there?

Bartosz Borek   1:18:19
I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think it's too long. I mean, I I definitely, I think, I think it's reasonable, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:18:22
I think it's still reasonable, right? People can scan it.
You can scan it like, yeah, yeah, OK, that header, that looks interesting to me. I'll read the phrase or the paragraph. If not, I keep on moving. But I feel like these are tight enough and there's stuff to call it out, like drawing your eye to CFOS guide to tech. OK, this forward-looking analysis becomes essential to strategic technology investment, right?
OK. I mean that's that's good that your eye is drawn to really quick consumption and you decide is it worthwhile to go further on that, right?

Bartosz Borek   1:18:57
Yeah, I'm just checking.

Peter Wolf   1:18:58
Maybe we cut down, maybe we cut down like and again, we control this by how many we select. Maybe we only put, you know, three items in trending social or three items in tools and to keep that a little tighter, only two items from us and this will be shorter. Yeah, I think, I think.

Bartosz Borek   1:19:17
I I think it's fine.

Peter Wolf   1:19:17
Given that we control the number of contents, I think we'll be good here. I think it's decent structure and size.

Bartosz Borek   1:19:21
I'm looking, I'm looking at some of the other newsletters that I get in my Gmail and they're it's pretty much standard to that so.

Peter Wolf   1:19:31
OK.
I mean, guys, look at this. This is impressive. We did this in a matter of it. This was not our focus right over a matter of a few weeks and and we've refined it to something that I think is really very professional looking, very sharp and I think the content is going to be enticing, right?

Bartosz Borek   1:19:36
Yeah, it really is.

Lem Quimpo   1:19:53
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:19:53
So hey, one thing I don't see here that I thought I saw in the earlier was there was like A and I know this isn't superhuman AI. There was a thing like what did you think of the newsletter and.
Hold on. So you sent this out based on the from Brevo right now, right? This is what I this is what I got just a minute ago. So if I click on some of these things because this is the other thing I think is amazing if I click on.

Lem Quimpo   1:20:15
Yeah, from Bravo. Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   1:20:16
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:20:23
This great. OK, I went to that. Now I come back and say I just want to click on a few things and see.
But uh.
What we're going to get for statistics, right? Can you log into Bravo Lem?

Lem Quimpo   1:20:46
Uh, Bravo. OK.

Peter Wolf   1:20:48
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:20:50
Oh, for the statistics, uh.

Peter Wolf   1:20:51
Frank, is this is whose account is this one right now? This is our account or who needs to log into it?

Lem Quimpo   1:20:54
Um, my no. Uh, yeah, it's on my account. Uh, right now.

Bryan Wolf   1:20:56
That one was his.

Lem Quimpo   1:21:02
So.
And then yeah, so I already saw here last 30 minutes we have two clicks.
And then?

Peter Wolf   1:21:13
OK. Can you share?
Oh, interesting. Lem, look what? Look what just happened here. I don't know. Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:21:17
Um, the logs.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:19
That link doesn't work.

Lem Quimpo   1:21:21
Oh yeah, that that's on the the prompt. So it already like because last time we were feeding the link from the AI viral prompts, so I actually removed now the link for on the title. So that would be just plain. Yeah, plain, just plain title.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:22
What's the problem?

Peter Wolf   1:21:33
OK.
OK.
So people would just people would just the expectation is they would just highlight and copy from here.

Lem Quimpo   1:21:40
Not a clip clickable.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, because we're not getting this one anymore on the Internet, so we're.

Peter Wolf   1:21:50
OK, good. Alright, so can you show what the what the like what your Bravo statistics show?

Lem Quimpo   1:22:00
OK, uh, let me just share my.

Peter Wolf   1:22:01
2.
And in the meantime, Bryan, you you got this as well just now, right? Can you click on a few things?

Lem Quimpo   1:22:05
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:22:12
I just want to see how this what this. Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:12
My e-mail? Yeah, sure.

Lem Quimpo   1:22:12
Uh.
Yeah, this one. So the yeah, we we could actually see the one. Your particular activity is not yet here on the logs, but I yeah, but mine is was already here like open like the test.

Peter Wolf   1:22:29
OK, so that update doesn't update immediately.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:34
The free version, I think, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:22:36
Use so it would appear here like the delivered, like the sent and then the first opening.

Peter Wolf   1:22:41
And so does it show like your account? Whose it shows the person's account that actually did the clicking, right? Or is it just overarching, not telling you specifics?

Lem Quimpo   1:22:49
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it would show. Yeah, it shows. Oh, yeah, it it actually shows who like. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, like the.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:51
Oh, when I click on a link it shows that.
But don't what? Oh, wow, that's so good. That's so good.

Peter Wolf   1:22:59
Who interacted? We can see who's active. OK, next question. Can we do an API and extract this data out and create some kind of report?

Lem Quimpo   1:23:04
Yep.
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think Bravo has like an endpoint for their statistics. So actually already because you mentioned already that also like in the past, so we could actually pull out the.

Peter Wolf   1:23:21
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:23:25
Just this one.

Peter Wolf   1:23:28
Yeah. Could we, could we make another flow in the newsletter that's kind of after the fact that sends a report out every day on how many people clicked on it or whatever? Because it obviously takes a little bit of time to update, but we could see what kind of interaction we're getting.

Lem Quimpo   1:23:31
Uh.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think, uh, we have that one like.
Um, I think this one the list. Uh, get a campaign.
Um, this one. So it I think this would list the.

Peter Wolf   1:23:55
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:24:01
Like the stats for that particular campaign. So let me just we could actually, for example this one. Yeah, this yeah, for this one statistics. So we could like global stats, link stats. So for example, I'll choose this one.
So we could see the the statistics here. So the click like the click uh.
Yeah, the for example the yeah this one like viewed trackable views, so unique views, unique clicks.

Peter Wolf   1:24:38
I think that would be huge. If we could get a report, a structured report every day that would show our campaigns and show what we what kind of engagement we got, that would be terrific.

Lem Quimpo   1:24:42
Yep.
Yeah, but I think, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:24:50
So I would just put that as another flow. I'd put it in the newsletter flow, but it's a standalone. It should trigger daily and just extract that content, create a e-mail with the summary of the information. It should have a link to get us to the.

Lem Quimpo   1:24:57
Yeah.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:25:06
To the actual campaign and if we wanted to get to it and then it should e-mail to a fixed e-mail address that we could put into a list or we could we could put another another tab in our spreadsheet that says who should be on the distribution list for the.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:15
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:25:22
Activity that takes place in.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:24
Yeah, that's right. I I would also need to, uh, update. Yeah, I think I.

Peter Wolf   1:25:26
Let's do that. Let's add another tab. Add another. Yeah, go ahead.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:30
Yeah, I would need to update this one because we would basically need another database for every campaign. So at the last node here we would add the campaign ID to another spreadsheet.

Peter Wolf   1:25:42
Oh, right. We already, so we already did this before. I knew it was familiar, but I didn't know we created. So that's where that create e-mail campaign that's coming out.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:47
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, I I would just route it to a different database, like a different sheet here because we need to like basically extract the.
Obviously we could also get like the company ID and then the sent filter out to filter out. What I was thinking is we this is actually just pulling out one by one. Where is it again?
On the Bravo.
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:26:27
What do we figure too, if if if someone hasn't opened it within two days, I'm not going to worry about going back to see later than that, right? I mean, people aren't typically going to leave it in their e-mail and come find it later on and look at it. Although I do that with superhuman AI, I put them in a folder and then I go back later on and.

Lem Quimpo   1:26:37
Yeah, I think.
Yeah, uh, what? What?

Peter Wolf   1:26:46
I do drill into them later.

Lem Quimpo   1:26:47
Yep, that's right. I think it would be much efficient if for example if you guys like send one newsletter per or for example 2 newsletter per week and then after seven days like we could get a like trigger this every seven days and then get all the result of the campaign for that seven days I think.

Peter Wolf   1:27:03
Yeah.
With the previous week, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:06
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:06
Yeah, for the previous week, I think that would be much, uh, I think much better. Yeah. Then we, I'll just, uh, put it on a spreadsheet.

Peter Wolf   1:27:09
OK, I like that.
In the meantime, obviously we can go directly to the to the Bravo and see information anytime we want, but this way we get a report essentially once per week for the previous week's content.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:19
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:27:26
So that you gave it several days to be able to to capture activity or for people to, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:31
Yeah, but but do do you also want like a like a recurring or just seven days and then like it won't process again next week, right? That's is that correct? Is that right or?

Peter Wolf   1:27:42
Yeah, I I think, I mean, I I think it should be, it should be a let me just think here. So if we're gonna have.
If we're going to have a spreadsheet that that tab that shows the people that should be on distribution list for it, then we could also have a trigger there, right?
We could just say trigger it once per week, or maybe we just schedule it in make to be once per week.

Lem Quimpo   1:28:07
Uh.
Yes, schedule it once per week. Yep. And then it would just pick out pick, pick the campaign here and then I would just add the column here that it's still not processed. Then after it's processed it will trigger that flow and then it will get all the stats for the seven.
7 days past seven days for the campaign and then it would populate the other spreadsheet like all the stats for that campaign. Or we could also like add it here if you want this column so that it won't be too much confusing too. So like we could see the.
For example, uh, this campaign and then I could add like the.
Um.
Like the campaign name here, then like the stats here or another sheet. So we could do that one.

Peter Wolf   1:29:06
How much data? It looked like there was a whole bunch of different criteria, right? It was like how many clicks and when you were just in there.

Lem Quimpo   1:29:06
Uh.
Yeah, yeah, this. For example, this one. There are clicks and.
Yeah, like unique clicks and then clickers. Um sent. So this one is sent out for uh yes, and then unique views.

Peter Wolf   1:29:31
Yeah, so that's essentially you want that full list. That's 369-1014. It looks like 15 different, 15 different categories.

Lem Quimpo   1:29:34
Viewed. Yeah.
Yeah. And then this one is percentage, I think like open rate. So this is 40% open rate on the all of the, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:29:49
So would it be too much to say take these 15 and put them across on columns? Maybe go to the campaign back in the spreadsheet and you say there's 15 values and you make each one of these. Yep, each one of those just becomes a.

Lem Quimpo   1:29:56
Here this one.
Here.

Peter Wolf   1:30:04
A value.

Lem Quimpo   1:30:05
Yeah, we, yeah, we can actually do that one. So we could just add it here then.

Peter Wolf   1:30:09
So one would be the link for the campaign ID itself. Would that take us to the website to the specific campaign? Could that? Could it give us a URL?

Lem Quimpo   1:30:17
Yeah this one. So the campaign ID is like the link for this one. So if I won't map this out, if map this one as you can see this is 72. This is the campaign ID. So to test it I just did the like chose the newsletter but we could map this out.

Peter Wolf   1:30:35
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:30:36
To basically get the campaign ID. So first is we would have like a search Google sheet and then search for the campaign if it's still not processed and then put the campaign ID here dynamically. Then yeah, it would search for that statistics and then put all of the stats here on the.
Columns here Ye.

Peter Wolf   1:30:56
I think that would be good because then also what you have is the ability to come back here and say, look at your campaigns. Did we have one campaign that did much better? You know, what was it? What drew that? And we can just see our consistency. How well are we doing over time? I think that would be terrific. That'd be a great update.

Lem Quimpo   1:31:02
Yeah, that's right. Yep.
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
OK, Yep, I'll add that new flow also stats. OK.

Peter Wolf   1:31:17
Awesome.
OK. Yeah, I think let's, let's move forward with those few items, which seems to be a decent amount. And now I know there's not much time left, but maybe then you should make those tweaks and then it could be tomorrow that you work with Brian. Brian, maybe.

Lem Quimpo   1:31:24
Um, yeah.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:31:40
We could do this. You could get up earlier and work with men, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:41
I think that's good. I think that's good. Yeah. Yeah, I can. I can totally get up earlier and we can we can get on a call before this call Lem. That way I don't have to just redo this every, you know, every time. But so I'm so Lem, if you just want to work on it, I'll I'll, I'll change, make changes that you've made today and and later today, tomorrow.

Lem Quimpo   1:31:44
I.

Peter Wolf   1:31:49
I think that would be great.
Yeah, yeah. So let's not. Let's not.

Lem Quimpo   1:31:53
Yeah.
OK. Yeah. Yeah, I'll just update it. I think just a little bit. I think the update would be only for the conclusion and yeah, basically they're just the conclusion. Then I could just send you the Jason links and yeah, you could.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:14
OK.
Uh.

Lem Quimpo   1:32:18
Connect them also and then if you're if some of them like arrowed out, we could like yeah troubleshoot it again. But yeah, I think most of these I already updated so I think I would need to.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:23
Troubleshoot worked out.

Peter Wolf   1:32:30
Austin.

Lem Quimpo   1:32:35
Give you the the new. Yeah, the new Jason. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:37
All of it. Basically I can tell I saw like you changed five and a couple others, but um, that's OK. I can hop on earlier. So you can hop on a call at 8:00 tomorrow.

Lem Quimpo   1:32:47
OK, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:48
OK, even better.

Lem Quimpo   1:32:50
8:00 PM OK.

Peter Wolf   1:32:51
All right. Perfect. Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. Thank you, Bart. Appreciate it. And yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:32:56
OK.

Bartosz Borek   1:32:56
Yeah, no problem. Thanks guys. This is, uh, this is a lot of good work done in the last day, so.

Peter Wolf   1:33:03
Hey, I got a reply from. I got a reply from Monica too. I just see an e-mail, so I'll check into that and I'll let you know what's going on.

Bartosz Borek   1:33:03
Lem, great job. Ryan, great job.

Lem Quimpo   1:33:04
OK.

Bartosz Borek   1:33:11
Alright, thanks.

Peter Wolf   1:33:12
All right. Thanks. Talk to you later, guys. Bye.

Lem Quimpo   1:33:13
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:15
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:33:15
OK, talk to you soon.
Oh.
Uh.
Coming thanks.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:25
But you updated all these 'cause I'm looking here and I I changed all my webhooks. Sorry I got my webhooks all lined up to the Excel sheet, but I'm seeing that five or #5 you added. You deleted the one you deleted the.

Lem Quimpo   1:33:31
OK.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:40
The viral prompt or uh, the automation tool or which one it was or at social media? I can't remember which one it was and uh.

Lem Quimpo   1:33:41
Yeah.
That's right.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:49
I think you added another scraper, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:33:51
I added the yeah I I added the Twitter one and then also the create a finance prompt but this the Twitter one is I just added it. I disabled it but basically this would be like the the appify actor. I could just copy paste the name the name of that one.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:57
OK.
OK.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:34:11
So I yeah, this would be a new one because I actually, yeah, created this, the other one.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:18
What else is between 7:00?

Lem Quimpo   1:34:21
Um, the number 2.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:21
No.
Three, maybe. I think 3. I don't have perplexity in my third one. I don't have perplexity in there. Yeah. Or whichever one was. Oh, I might have the same one here. Yeah, you gotta. Yeah. OK. All right. I'm.

Lem Quimpo   1:34:26
Yeah, the number 3 also.
Uh, no, I.
Yeah.
But I updated the content here also on #3.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:39
No, keep go. Yeah, OK or.

Lem Quimpo   1:34:42
Uh for the formatting of the HTML I've added the like the links but need to test it out also 1st and then.
Yeah, the numbers. Yeah, we we're already using.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:54
Yes, six. I changed to. I gotta add that perplexity in there. So did you. You also showed me something like yesterday. I gotta go through the room, but we can always do this tomorrow. But I remember what it was. I I gotta go through my thing.

Lem Quimpo   1:34:57
Perplexity. Yeah. Uh, also.
Uh.
OK yeah for #9 do do you already also have the like this like the side image keyword or?

Bryan Wolf   1:35:21
No, I don't. No.

Lem Quimpo   1:35:22
Oh, right. So yeah, I I'm also like quite confused if I updated this today or like yesterday. So yeah, I I can't remember also like, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:30
Yeah, that's alright. Let's just do tomorrow morning and send me everything and then I'll be on at 8. OK, So I'm gonna schedule a meeting like now and then we'll meet then, OK?

Lem Quimpo   1:35:38
OK.
Oh yeah, I I think, yeah, that would be good also with all the updated ones, OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:45
All right, love. Awesome. You're the man. Thank you.

Lem Quimpo   1:35:49
Goodbye. Talk to you soon. Talk tomorrow. See ya.
