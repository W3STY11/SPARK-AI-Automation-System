Peter Wolf   0:03
And pull **** together. What I wanted to do is talk about what the hold on one second.
Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait one second.
I just got a message.
Give me a second here.

Nicholas Westburg   0:12
Not recording it.

Bryan Wolf   0:14
I got transcribing.

Nicholas Westburg   0:26
Thing by the copper, iron.

Bryan Wolf   0:28
Huh.

Nicholas Westburg   0:29
Is due for one.

Bryan Wolf   0:31
I didn't.
You just go on last week.

Nicholas Westburg   0:33
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   0:35
This one is.

Peter Wolf   0:36
OK.
So here's here's a situation.
I I laid this out as part of what we would deliver as part of this program, right?
I don't have a commitment right now to deliver some massive amount of information, right?
And I don't feel obligated to do that. What I am feeling pressured to do is to show something because my COO is under pressure to show something right there.
I'm already pushing them and but they're under pressure because.
The company that owns us, the private equity company HG Capital, just came down hard on these guys and.

Bryan Wolf   1:13
For what?

Peter Wolf   1:14
Well, because our company is doing a **** job of positioning itself as an AI first company and competitors are competitors.
They went out and did like deep research on them, on their marketing and their everything, every other word they say is AI and we're doing a **** job of portraying that same vision, right?
Enough of showing that we're on the cutting edge.
So they're getting a lot of heat for that and this **** that I came up with, this whole sparks program and all this kind of stuff pushing this stuff.
Is help gives them a way to kind of help show that we're stimulating this stuff internally and externally and and also just you know I've complained.

Bryan Wolf   1:50
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:54
Well, I won't say I've given constructive feedback that the programs the way they're approaching them for this operational AI stuff is just not successful.
And this is the stuff that we're.
Trying to help stimulate is to show to give more concrete examples of stuff that people can can look at to help them come up with more organically ideas.
So this is what they're looking for, for us to do for me to do is start to create a repository that can we can be rolling out to people to get them acclimated to AI1 of the tools. What is the way they can learn terminology? How can.
They start using AI.
How can they start using large language models and where can they learn?
Right. That what we talked about courses, certifications.
That's the stuff we want to be compiling.
We want to be pulling together, prompting and showing them opportunities.
They can use prompts these flows that we're creating ultimately I think are gonna be flows that we're gonna include and roll out. And so right now, I'm really focused on the knowledge foundation.
How do they ramp up?

Nicholas Westburg   2:57
Help them.

Peter Wolf   2:57
How can we put together a repository of ramp up content that we think is attractive and you know?
For me, some of it is about the learning and some of it where it's possible is to actually put some concrete tools on the table and concrete tools, for example, is the is the prompting 1 right?
Creating a repository of prompts and maybe we even create a custom GPT that that has all that content in it that people can use and we can give the GPT. We can say you know here it is. We can make it out in the public and they could.
Use it and we can just.
Feed all this content into GPT on prompting.
So I'm thinking trying to think of creative ways like that. Now if you look at that superhuman AI newsletter at the bottom, they have a list connection to a list of 12-12 hundred prompts or 1000 prompts.

Bryan Wolf   3:47
1000 lbs.

Peter Wolf   3:50
Most of them are only one line, but I think even stealing all that **** and putting them together and then going out and finding where are other places you know, on Reddit or wherever, where can we find comprehensive lists of prompts?
And curate a massive list of prompts that people can use.
Not all of them have to be exactly oriented to specific business.
It's about thinking in broader context and how can they?
How can they use these?
But certainly we would be emphasizing things like, you know, marketing, operational excellence, you know the creation of documents, creation of presentations, all that kind of stuff, stuff that people would be able to use operationally.
In everyday and that would be, I think kind of our first place is doing.
That, along with the curating a list of YouTube videos for training of certification programs for training and US building that whole thing, and then giving some kinds of reviews or something.
Or maybe we run the text the transcripts through ChatGPT and we give a summary.
And that summary will also go in the repository. So it's like, hey, you're looking. Here's some YouTube videos. Here's a YouTube.
Here's a summary of the YouTube the highlights and key points and things you can walk away with. That's us.
The list, not just putting a list out there, but going further than that, categorizing giving some additional content to say, hey, we think this is really fundamental.
This is YouTube video #1.
You should do if you're going into looking at LMS and just trying to understand them or just trying to understand this aspect of that or prompting or whatever and really building the list out.
So I don't feel commitment to deliver anything more than that, but that's what I need to start pulling together and what I want to start pulling.
Together and what we need to figure out is what are the different avenues? What are the different categories?
What are the different tools?
Is it prompts I look at as tools.
I think creating some custom gpt's and then some instructional videos on how to create a custom GPT and give you some examples of you know full-fledged example like a writing GPT where we can say we can even give them our sample.
Here's a sample of our content for.
Serrala sts.
For serrala information, for a personal resume and you know, and a persona, and then we load that up and then we give them those documents as well and say, hey, here's sample documents you can use.
And here's a training guide.
So I'll get that. Whatever is scribe, I think it's called any process you do online, you can turn this thing on.
Just walk through it now. I can't remember if that one has talking where it will take your words and convert them, or if it just does the screen part of it.
I would like to find one that.
Is that with talking so you could talk and it would include that verbage.
It would summarize in whatever, not just capture the screens and highlight the buttons you push could for sure Scribe does that. You walk through a screen, you hit a button, it highlights, it puts an arrow showing you.
It shows the next step and it just creates a document, but I would like one where you actually talk along with it, and it would supplement that. Maybe you guys could do some research on that on.
We'll kind of training documentation preparation and you can put in scribe.
An example and see if.
See if there are.
You know what other tools are out there and you can even say, you know, looking for kind of audio input supplement for summary of the process steps or something.
Right. So that's that's what I see as a foundation then I think we start with the process flows and we start including those, but I don't think we're gonna include the externals.

Bryan Wolf   7:19
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   7:26
It's when we start to take these inside to the Microsoft environment, which we need to get started on. We can start up the meetings with Jill and and you know.
Again, looking at taking these things and moving them into that environment, I did a research on on resources that have this skill set, so I'm going to start interviewing there and try and get a LEM equivalent. I think we hit jackpot with Lem to be honest with you.
I mean his price and he's he's really pretty sharp.
Obviously, he's still, you know, inexperienced, but it's not shown at the level we are, right.
He's he's freaking way experienced compared to us and and putting **** together, and I haven't seen him stumble really well.
Coming up new ideas. He's very quick to be like, OK, go over here.

Bryan Wolf   8:09
Right there in the spot.

Peter Wolf   8:09
Gotta do this, OK?
Gotta check that out.

Nicholas Westburg   8:10
And he's he's working all night too.

Bryan Wolf   8:11
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   8:12
He is it midnight there when we meet in the morning or damn near close to it, yeah.

Peter Wolf   8:15
Yeah, it's 11:00. We, we go to 9:00 to 11:00, it's 11:00.

Bryan Wolf   8:17
Yeah, you know what?
You know what? You know what?
I asked him.

Peter Wolf   8:19
He's 12 hours ahead.

Nicholas Westburg   8:21
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   8:21
I asked him to help me. I was he.

Peter Wolf   8:22
Yes.

Bryan Wolf   8:24
He got back to me like 1030 eleven last night, so we can even utilize him like, late at night if we really wanted to.

Peter Wolf   8:24
Yeah.
Well, no, no.

Nicholas Westburg   8:30
He's learning too.

Peter Wolf   8:30
We gotta watch out.

Nicholas Westburg   8:31
He's working all the time too.

Peter Wolf   8:31
I gotta if he's. If he's working, that's fine.
But here's what I'm saying is I feel like.
Our commitment of the training session from 9:00 to 11:00, essentially that's committed, right?
So from my perspective, Brian, if you let him off, it's like, hey, no, I'm. I'm gonna probably ping you back again, right?
So I just, I would always say expectation is 'til 11. He's gonna be there, right?

Bryan Wolf   8:57
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   8:57
But after that what I do is then later on in the day.
Or late in the evening, I'll send him stuff for the next day.
Because then attempt you know, 9:00. It's 9:00 AM his time so he can take that stuff to start working on that for the next day if he doesn't already have something. Right. And that's been working out pretty well.

Bryan Wolf   9:12
Right, OK. All right.

Peter Wolf   9:15
He's been by the time we then come in 10 hours later, you know he's got, he's got the next set of **** to move on with and he's making those tweaks and everything else so.

Bryan Wolf   9:16
Yeah.
He's prepped.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   9:26
So Nick, you weren't on there today, but we went through again the process flow for this newsletter.
And I'm really excited about this. And I know Peter, I don't think he thinks it's like it's a big deal with this.
Some personal I tell you this.

Nicholas Westburg   9:37
Peter San and I commented back.
I went 'cause I got the ping like an hour ago from from Peter and I was like this is awesome. Yeah, it's great.

Peter Wolf   9:40
Is.

Nicholas Westburg   9:46
It's great.

Peter Wolf   9:46
I really think this flow and the way we were going through it and I just don't have enough time to focus on this stuff is a problem, but I understand and I want to and I will as much as I can.
But we were going deep in and the thing was when I was doing the flows earlier, I was just like, let's get a baseline flow in.
It will give you guys you might have experience, but Brian and and Peter don't to give them experience.
So just getting started getting the flows, getting all the API, setting up, getting all the accounts set up, getting.

Nicholas Westburg   10:11
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   10:14
The understanding of this working.
With Lem get a feel for Lem, but I really want to be developing flows that are comprehensive, useful, real flows, not with missing all kinds of components. I want them to have the component.
So today we were going through. I wanna go here. I wanna go there now.
Ultimately, I realigned and decided on.
A path that was a little easier.
But this is where I think this is where I believe that my experience can actually be informative to you guys. 'cause thinking in this more complex process oriented.
Way, even though these are relatively simplified things, thinking in that context of a process flow and OK where do I wanna go? What's the validation?
How am I pulling this in?
Where all the other places that I can execute, how can I deliver more value into this?
How can I get notifications?
How can I get automation?
I think they're all very helpful and just thinking about the process like that I think is very helpful.
And then again, I intend to take these and move them into the Microsoft environment where that I think at that point.
That becomes enterprise, right?
I mean, right now we're building them.
Certainly you could go to a company. I honestly this process flow we're building right now. You could go to any mid size company and not mid size a small company for sure you could go to them and say I can help you build a newsletter that would go.
Out would put you in a position of thought leadership.
You could put all your extra stuff down here, show and showcase all your extra stuff and it would be one click of a button, right?

Nicholas Westburg   11:35
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   11:41
I mean, that's massive stuff that you could just, you know, accelerate but this.

Nicholas Westburg   11:43
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   11:45
Same thing at the at the enterprise level. I'm looking at this and saying to my leadership guys, we can put this in every team, right?
Every consulting team and their specialized area, every product team and their specialized area and create this.
I mean, our marketing team sucks, to be honest with you.
Actually, the new head of marketing just pinged me because we're supposed to have a meeting because the previous chief marketing officer just wasn't wasn't doing.
It wasn't achieving.
I'm saying guys, this is the **** you need to be doing.
This is what you need to be bringing to us.
But they're not.

Bryan Wolf   12:16
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   12:16
So I'm bringing it to them.
So I want to refine this and make this really work and then yeah, I want to put it into place.
This is this is not me trying to do something for myself.
This is me showing at a business level.
This is this is value add right.
That I just know, because I know Peter's been a little bit frustrated thinking I'm working on stuff. That's all you know, personal to me and some of it is no doubt, but it's also.
Even on this like what I had the other day, that personal blogging thing.
Well, I knew that was gonna lead into this newsletter stuff.
So curating the news feed is already gonna be part.
That's an easier process flow.
Just curate the news feed.
Feed it to me.
Let me pick one and blood.

Nicholas Westburg   12:55
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   12:55
That's easier than the newsletter, so I wanted to start with something simple.
Get the concepts.
Get the interface.
Get the curation of the news and start the process flow now.
We're already leveraging that one into the newsletter, right? So.

Bryan Wolf   13:08
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   13:09
These things we're learning are going to be leverageable, and the stuff I was asking Brian about him to.
You know add a add a e-mail here or grab an extra input over there.
These are the things that when you start to see the way he's pulling them together with the different routers going different places or that loop that he's doing right, that iterate, they iterate and then you gotta do the end is the aggregate, right?

Bryan Wolf   13:28
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   13:31
Integrate, aggregate, iterate, aggregate mean that kind of ****.
That's where you understand the process flow. The way make does it, because that's not something in a process flow in general.
You don't know that it's coming out in individual pieces and you.
Pull them together.
That only comes from the fact that we have a scenario that did that.
Now you recognize, OK.
That's the way it's gonna come out of ChatGPT. I'm gonna have to do this.
Iterate and aggregate.
Well, that's a good learning experience, right?
And like you said, some of the stuff he's bringing in, OK, no thumbnail, OK.
Well, he knows to go and create a thumbnail, right?
There wasn't a thumbnail.

Bryan Wolf   14:04
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   14:04
He creates one from some tool he knows exists.
That's an arbitrary create a business oriented thumbnail for an image to go overtime.
That's stuff where you guys just getting into the process flows and drilling into them as much as they may see.
Simple, they are informing you of deep, deep stuff. When I look at it, I go. **** like this is where you need to drill in the fact that it's HTML or you got to practice writing the HTML.
Well freaking go to ChatGPT.
Get used to take a **** and put it in HTML. What we're gonna do is this newsletter. First thing I wanna do is say, plug that into ChatGPT, plug in the superhuman and say I want mine to be crisper.

Bryan Wolf   14:33
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   14:41
I want it to be like this.
OK.
Great. How do I reorient it?
How do I change that HTML?
Make it tighter to make the lines bolder to make whatever.
But that's also stuff.
It's all about all these inputs.
It's not just the process flow, it's understanding how to use these different components and tools.
So that's one thing I just wanna make sure it's clear to you guys. It's not.
Just let me just learn the process flow.
You gotta understand how the tools work, how the how the information passes between.
That's the only way you could say.
You're informed and you can build these flows, right?

Bryan Wolf   15:12
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   15:14
And that only comes from this iteration, like I was saying, Brad, going into the flows and finding a step where you could screw it up.
What happens if I send a thing that says research and the URL is incorrect, right?

Bryan Wolf   15:23
I got you. I got you.

Peter Wolf   15:25
That's good learning ****. That's where you really learn is when things break.
How do I troubleshoot it?
How do I fix it?
How do I understand what the problem was right?
So. So that's what I want to achieve. Is that right now focused on the on the curation of.
Of information at the base level, right?
The lowest level that we're starting with and that's going to be prompting AI tutorials certification.

Bryan Wolf   15:49
Listen, yeah.

Peter Wolf   15:56
Creation of prompts actually lists of prompts, lists of again.
YouTube personalities and channels that you can go to this like newsletters like that one.
I sent out that all should be going in there and saying OK, how do we build the repository?
To look at her, make it so it's not so overwhelming, right?
It's got to be categorized.

Bryan Wolf   16:18
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   16:19
Got to be tight.
It's got to be categorized in two ways. Types of media, and then categorization of what, right?
So I would say if you're building a spreadsheet when we're compiling this at first, if we have YouTube videos, well, the type of media is a video YouTube video.
But the what is OK.
What category is it prompting?
Is it AI in general?
Is it you know llm's?
Is it process automations?
So we got to come up with what those categories aren't.
You can't know that.
All right away.
OK, you start categorizing and you see well these two categories are very close.
Why don't we merge them in one nameer?

Bryan Wolf   16:53
Yeah, listen, you're rambling. You're rambling.

Peter Wolf   16:54
There's so much to split it, right? I'm not ready.

Bryan Wolf   16:56
You're rambling, you're rambling.
You're rambling.

Peter Wolf   16:57
I hitting on new specific information so.
OK.
So with that, that's what I'm trying to achieve. That's what I'm trying to achieve.

Bryan Wolf   17:06
OK. All right.

Nicholas Westburg   17:07
I feel like the the hardest part, not the hardest part, but the most that just eats me up is like thinking like OK man, there's so many different techniques. You know, we have treasury, we have marketing.
We have HR.

Peter Wolf   17:20
And this is the thing. If you. Yeah. Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   17:21
There's this way to prompt it.
There's that way.

Peter Wolf   17:24
So here's the thing, Nick.

Nicholas Westburg   17:24
There's millions of different prompts.
It's like ****.

Peter Wolf   17:26
Nick, I'm stressed myself on the 500 different shiny objects in 500 different directions.
Can't do it all.
So what we gotta start with is a court, especially when you go back to thinking the people that are gonna use this are probably haven't hardly exposed at all.

Nicholas Westburg   17:33
Yeah.
Right, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   17:40
Yeah, very dumb down low.

Peter Wolf   17:41
They're not thinking on these multiple aspects of how do you do it?
They're like, give me one.
Give me ******* started, right?

Nicholas Westburg   17:48
Sign me up. Where's the link?

Peter Wolf   17:48
So it's like, yeah, but I also think let me add another one here, make sure it gets captioned in those like, I think AI think a matrix that compares the different models, right.
The different llm's to use. I think that's huge.

Nicholas Westburg   18:01
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   18:05
Like, what's the pricing?
What are the different plans?
What? What's the pros and cons?
What are the considered the best ones because.
Right now, you know, it's like Opus 4 is one of the best for certain aspects, certainly for writing.
Coding is over here.
OK.
Well, Sonic 4 is good, but you got codex and you got these other things as the chat. Gpd has new codex, the equivalent of codex, but it integrates with bit up. I think creating a matrix like that would be really valuable, just to orientate the landscape, say these.
Are the frickin 10 main tools that people use right now when you're talking about engaging with?
Language model.
They're the primaries.
And hey, here's pros and cons.
These two have audio interface, right?
You got it on your PC.

Nicholas Westburg   18:48
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   18:50
You can do it in, but you don't get audio out or on the phone. You get both and say these are benefits. I think that would be huge.
That would be massive.
A foundational kind of overarching matrix where we feed it in and say pros and cons.
And which one?
Maybe you want to focus on ease of use or that kind of stuff.

Nicholas Westburg   19:07
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   19:09
That's another one to to incorporate.

Nicholas Westburg   19:11
I also I have a big curator list.

Bryan Wolf   19:11
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   19:13
I always, you know, blow blow the group, chat up with those images, but they're really, really good. And I don't know if we could take those and do something with them or include them some. Some which way.

Peter Wolf   19:16
Yeah, they're great.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, this is.
I get those on LinkedIn.
All the time. And I'm like, oh ****, I want it.

Nicholas Westburg   19:25
They're great.

Peter Wolf   19:26
I just save it but I never get back to them right?

Nicholas Westburg   19:28
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   19:28
There's all these great lists that come out of LinkedIn.
People put them out all the time. I mean, I think we need to be looking at those, putting them into ChatGPT and saying, hey, how can I put this into a repository?

Nicholas Westburg   19:31
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   19:39
What's a way that I can manage this to make it consumable?
Is it really best in this in this picture form? Maybe it is?
Maybe we then create a carousel of these kinds of things we create on Canva and Bart is very good with Canva. You put a carousel together in Canva. That's all. These just things like that, and we could categorize them and say okay. These are about using AI these.

Nicholas Westburg   19:51
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   20:02
Are about process automation.
These are about prompting.
These are about whatever, but you somehow got to categorize.
It can't be so random that people just don't know where to even start.
Why would I look at this 'cause? I don't even. It's a hundred of them, and I'm gonna have to look through 90.
Before I find one I like, I need to subcategorize or something.
But again, let's start at the most base level.

Nicholas Westburg   20:22
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   20:23
It's the it's a matrix overview of the different LLM models and some kind of difference on the pricing and pros and cons or what are considered the best ones or what we've seen as benefits or challenges with those particular models, right?
And I would include things like. Well, it's got audio, but half the time the audio doesn't work.
Right. So you know, I go over to this other model or something.
I think that would be that.
That's where we gotta start. And then we'll yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   20:52
That's what when I when I first like started like posting when I was super technical because I I somewhat understood it, but I wanted to to be as like precise by the book as possible, right.
And just because people like, you know, hire tech, whatever the people in the field appreciate that.
But I learned to realize that.
One, it doesn't help anybody. And two that I I began to realize that if you explain something to somebody in in a way that a kindergartner can understand.
Stand without losing the value or the true meaning behind it.
Anybody can understand it and learn it. And that's where, like engagement and people became more curious.

Peter Wolf   21:27
Yeah.
But that's what we got to be trying to do here is we're trying to.
We really got to be thinking these people are just ramping up.

Nicholas Westburg   21:35
And it's hard.
It's hard to do to figure out how to do that in a way which you know not only you and Brian understand, but your entire LinkedIn community and network understands company understands Real understands.

Peter Wolf   21:48
Agree. So are you.
I mean, you guys OK again on timing too?
So I just talked to COO on Monday and he asked me if I wanted his assistant to get involved, to help us kind of manage it.
I.
I at least said yeah, because I'll let her kinda get involved and figure out maybe on the SharePoint site or she can engage other people figuring out what's going to be the best structure. But.
But that also kinda delays it some until she gets involved.
I don't feel like I gotta hand them something right the 2nd.
As long as we're already curating stuff.

Bryan Wolf   22:21
OK. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   22:23
And I say, hey, here's a foundation.
Let's go figure out what's gonna be the best way to deliver the content. You know, she can go research with the IT team. How we gonna manage this on SharePoint or whatever.
And she can handle the structuring and building a SharePoint site.
We don't have to worry about that.
We just curate it.
But I do like the idea of AI, because again, it's kind of bringing the technology into it, I think.
A cool custom GBT that's a prompting GBT where we.
We've already fed it massive **** load and then, you know, say you're specifically a prompting guru.
That's its persona.
And then we go out and find as much prompt information as we can. Put that prompt information in as training material and as supplemental material and then say, yeah, if someone asks, here's already prepackaged, you should first go like a rag and go grab these and bring those.
Out and then supplement with anything you think with using these techniques and that stuff.
I think that would be an awesome one.
And again it's to me.
These are really cool.
That's something you could go out and put on GitHub, right?
Small, relatively easy, but it sounds really cool.
This is you're helping to build a learning a learning mechanism for the organization as a whole. That's that's transferable to anywhere you would go, right?

Bryan Wolf   23:30
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   23:40
Knowing that you helped build these tools and you could build those tools somewhere else.

Nicholas Westburg   23:44
Yeah. Can I share what we have so far?

Peter Wolf   23:47
Sure. Yeah, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   23:47
I have it up just.

Bryan Wolf   23:48
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   23:50
Like what'd you say, Brian?

Bryan Wolf   23:52
Oh no.
Go for it.

Nicholas Westburg   23:57
May I see my screen?
See my screen.

Peter Wolf   23:59
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   24:01
So like a quick start, obviously.
Rough draft.
Clean it up so you have quick start kind of right.
Like different tools and whatnot, you have LLM comparison which is brief.
Still need to fill it out so LLM. Platform right.

Peter Wolf   24:13
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   24:15
ChatGPT. Claude.
You know, maybe incorporate the models and features and whatnot. We have key features best for context window in terms of like token size.

Peter Wolf   24:26
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   24:26
Does it have web browsing or or? Or can you upload files or or what are the the core specs and and features?
Years of that specific model or that specific company?

Peter Wolf   24:35
Yep, I love it. Yeah, great. Awesome.

Nicholas Westburg   24:39
Channels from YouTube, right?

Peter Wolf   24:41
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   24:41
So you have, like Matthew Berman like.

Peter Wolf   24:42
Here's where.
Here's where we would probably want to stay. You know, we will want to add some value of our view is like these are the top three and or in each area. And if you were trying to focus on this, this would be the guy you'd want to listen.

Nicholas Westburg   24:54
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   24:55
To or you know how frequently they do.
They post maybe.
Or this guy like I were thing. I think his is great. It comes out once per week, right?

Nicholas Westburg   25:02
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   25:02
Packed with good stuff.
So it's like, OK, you know, I would give some kind of prioritization or something more.
That we're helping them figure out 'cause. If I look at this, I'll be like.
****, man, this take me a week to even just look at him, right?
Say, hey, this is a whole bunch of really good ones.
We're gonna rank the top three in every area or in these certain areas. If you're trying to focus on it, this is where we think you get the biggest bang for your buck, right?

Nicholas Westburg   25:26
How do we make it stand out and and have people engage with it?

Peter Wolf   25:29
Well, how do we how do we make people feel like when they look at this, they're just not overwhelmed just as much as if I went to YouTube and said, show me some what are the channels I should look at?

Nicholas Westburg   25:33
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   25:38
I mean, they could do that.
They're gonna get 100 channels.
We're trying to help show that we're giving something to get them further along, right?

Nicholas Westburg   25:44
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   25:45
We're giving them material that's gonna let them focus their time and get the best value out of it that we did the extra work of figuring out which are the best ones. And it's not saying there aren't lots of other good ones.
We're just trying to say, hey, I'm gonna bring you a little value. Let.
Focus on these few right here. That's where you're gonna get the biggest bang for the buck.

Nicholas Westburg   26:02
Yep.
Let's go through certifications, right?

Peter Wolf   26:06
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   26:08
You know, like the Google cloud.
Whatever deep the Coursera, whatever, all the different ones.
Kaggle, LinkedIn right provider, Microsoft, Google, Google Cloud, IBM, MIT. Which is this? The one that you are in, Mr. Wolf? No.

Peter Wolf   26:23
No, that's that's a. Oh, no, that's that. Can't be a free one.

Nicholas Westburg   26:27
Now, yeah.

Peter Wolf   26:28
Yeah, we gotta watch out.
So we got pricing without 'cause. I think the lowest one they offer is like 6000 bucks or something. But I mean there are a lot.

Nicholas Westburg   26:31
Look.
Yeah. So you want everything free?

Peter Wolf   26:37
There are a lot of opening freer ones just to get people acclimated and then they then they, you know, sell them on the real programs. But anything that's like that, I would think would be more expensive.

Nicholas Westburg   26:40
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   26:46
But maybe I'm again. It says 12 weeks, but they might be the online certification class that might not be the the kind of engaging with the faculty is just recordings of the of the of the stuff. So.

Nicholas Westburg   26:56
Yep.

Peter Wolf   26:57
Yeah, but that and we have to clarify.
For like training platform, right?
Coursera actually cost you something. I think it's now 55 for the all inclusive, right?
Every video, there's like a cheaper version.
It's like 45, but you know people can pack in as much as they want. They can start A and we can even say something there.
Give them some guidance like Coursera.
Yeah you can.
You can sign up. First of all, you get seven days free or something like that.
Can't get all videos but you can start videos and you can you cancel anytime and you want to go in there and pack it in a month and work your *** off.
You could learn a **** load for $55 if you want to keep as long as that's a lot of money to a lot of people.

Nicholas Westburg   27:33
Oh yeah.

Peter Wolf   27:36
But I think we still need to be doing it and then we need to say, OK, on the free, free on the real free.
Here's where you go, right?
Unfortunately, you know you're gonna. You're gonna be curating YouTube videos instead.
Go back over to the YouTube thing, but if you want certification and you want something that goes on your LinkedIn profile, then great.
This is where you're gonna do it.
You gotta make a little bit of investment in yourself.

Nicholas Westburg   27:57
Yeah.
Prompt right? So.

Peter Wolf   28:04
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   28:04
General prompts list of these you know scenario planning. Just a critical thinking.

Peter Wolf   28:10
I.
I love it.
I love it again.
I would go to the to the to the list that's on that superhuman. I think there's a bunch of stuff to grab there.

Nicholas Westburg   28:16
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   28:18
I think going out and doing a deep search on other repositories of of, of, of props and us going through and kind of filtering out again kind of curating it for for a more specific set of lists, maybe things that aren't of interest or.
Generally, to people that we're trying to train.

Nicholas Westburg   28:38
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   28:39
But also I have this.
Thing, hold on to Google Chrome. Add on that.

Nicholas Westburg   28:46
Oh, that was another thing.
I yeah, Google Chrome extensions are so big that's we could include that.

Peter Wolf   28:50
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   28:52
Maybe somewhere.

Peter Wolf   28:53
Yeah. Yeah, I would.
I'd put a folder.
I mean a table in here, just so we keep remem memory of it. But like I have one that's a it's a it's ChatGPT extension that gives you folders to manage. It gives you much more capability, but I think it also has a whole prompting repository.

Nicholas Westburg   29:09
Oh yeah.

Peter Wolf   29:10
So yeah, so that that'd be worth checking into.
Yeah, I mean this looks great.
Again, what we got to start doing is pulling some the the the links to them and and then figuring out how do we how do we categorize some of them a little bit more and maybe it's already categorized enough.

Nicholas Westburg   29:28
It just looks like *** ****, to be honest with you.
It just looks like a slab of *** **** with a lot of words on it and.

Peter Wolf   29:33
Well, that's what I'm saying.
It's a lot if someone looks at this right now, they'd be like, well, I'm just as confused as I was 5 minutes ago.

Nicholas Westburg   29:39
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   29:39
What we're trying to do is bring some order to the chaos and so there has to be something that says, look, here's the list.
We think if you were getting started, we also need to curate this.
Maybe some **** we drop.
We definitely prioritize and say here's the top three in each of these areas and and we go from there. But I really like the idea of maybe trying to build a custom GPT with this input.
It.

Nicholas Westburg   30:03
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   30:04
I think that would be kind of cool.
And then you go in and you say, hey, I'm looking. I'm interested in this area with this focus. What tools? And then it goes.
Here's YouTube videos. Here's certifications.
Here's prompts that would be pretty freaking cool. We structure.

Nicholas Westburg   30:16
Oh yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   30:19
We tell it how to come up the output.
That would be freaking amazing.
I would love that.

Nicholas Westburg   30:22
Yeah, be like a Zapier custom GPA.

Peter Wolf   30:26
No. Just take a ChatGPT and you just do it directly and we put it out in the public.
We build a custom GPT that we feed all this information to with the with the YouTube video links with our prioritizations with categorizations across categories across topics across media types, and then we say if someone asks you, you are focused only on on learning and prepping and train.
For how to use AI right, you should disregard.
Everything else, don't answer questions on other ****.
You bring everything back to your topic is you're focused on helping people learn about AI, and then you give the input into the documents you put in the spreadsheet and maybe you figure out talk with chat GP.
What's the best way to put the content in so that you can consume it and feed it back to me?
Then we put in a structure when someone asks what what the structure should be when they send it back to them.
Right, you say.
Well, you should if they give you a category or we even tell it right.
You know, you put the prompts, sample prompts at the bottom.
We put those sample prompts in the custom GPT and say hey tell me where if I wanted to Start learning about just llm's. OK great here OK.
Here's a matrix on the llm's on their pricing on their value.
Which ones?
Here's videos on them.
Here's certifications on them.
Here's prompting, and again we organize a structured response.
It would always come back and it would pull from all the different areas.
And categorize them as types of media.

Nicholas Westburg   31:55
The problem I see with that like custom GPT wise is the the context limit. You know you're gonna hit your contacts limit quick.

Peter Wolf   31:55
And gives the URL links.

Nicholas Westburg   32:02
You're gonna get this hallucinations. The best way to do that is like a rag system.

Peter Wolf   32:05
I don't think so.
Hold on. Hold on.
I'm not telling it.

Nicholas Westburg   32:07
The rag system it.
I mean, it's a lot more complex.

Peter Wolf   32:09
I got you.

Nicholas Westburg   32:11
I mean, but you build something and you like a scuppled database and it directly pulls exactly what you're looking for and reduces all that hallucination.

Peter Wolf   32:12
Hello.
OK.
Look, we can and we could certainly do that.
We could build a custom gpti mean custom GPT using the O Lama and and download. It doesn't have to be one of those high level logic ones.

Nicholas Westburg   32:23
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   32:27
We could do a small one, right?
Because we're talking about a simple a simple database, this would be awesome.

Nicholas Westburg   32:31
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   32:32
And we could do with the rag and we would put the content in there, right. Our spreadsheet plus documents we would find as many documents as we can on on all these topics on prompting on prompt engineering, on certifications on whatever.
And and that we could build that way, I was thinking a little bit simpler level on a basic ChatGPT custom GPT with the documents.
I don't think you really run into your limit.
I've loaded up hundreds of pages. You can put 20 documents and 20 documents at 500 Meg each.

Nicholas Westburg   33:02
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   33:04
And what we're talking about is not the all the content it's going to be the, you know, primarily the kind of list, although we would want something like.
You know summaries and our priorities.
And you know, because I think they would all be helpful and as we load them up, we could have chat, GPD writing the custom summaries for those.
Go out, find it from the transcript.
This is what I'm saying.
You download transcripts from YouTube videos.
Put it into chat gvd and said give me a summary. Give me why what the most critical points are. And we put that in the repository in the spreadsheet. Right now I would be thinking about populated spreadsheet.
I love the idea of custom GPT, whether it's our own LLM, very simplistic, low end model with a rag that we pull.
Specifically, from the content we have, I love that right.
But I think right now is curating the content.
It really gets started curating the content.

Nicholas Westburg   33:54
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   33:57
Right.

Nicholas Westburg   33:59
Yeah, definitely.

Peter Wolf   34:02
All right. So I think the path to your own is great.
I think we need to start filling that in with the with the links and then I think what would be wise when you go to get the link, you just download the transcript as well and tag a transcript with an ID that you can use with EU.
Link put it into a into a folder.
So the spreadsheet so you have to put it onto a Google Drive, right?
So we can all get to. It's gonna be where if you move it, you lose all the links, right?
But if you got a cloud based Google Drive.
And we we have the.
The you know URL for the video or whatever it is.
Then you download a transcript, put that on a document on a folder that's specifically transcripts folder, and a link to that.
Then you can say, OK, now feed that into ChatGPT.
Give me a summary.
Give me the key points that are covered in this particular video and then we can put them in and rank them, and then we can have that little thing. And again we do a custom GPT that could give you the summary and the URL and a overview of.
The key points.
That would be pretty friggin cool.
So right now it's about continue to fill in what you got and really adding that that depth. The URL links, transcripts and and again finding more comprehensive content then we can figure out, OK, how do we curate this?

Nicholas Westburg   35:20
Yeah.
So do you like Treasury specific?

Peter Wolf   35:22
OK. Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   35:25
That's kind of just been like in brain. It's like it's like, ****, how do you?

Peter Wolf   35:27
I will not.
I know. Look, no, no.

Nicholas Westburg   35:29
How do you scale this? Like ROI?

Peter Wolf   35:29
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. I.

Nicholas Westburg   35:31
How do you scale it to enterprise and upper management?

Peter Wolf   35:33
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no.
You're you're going.
You're you're 10 steps beyond where we need to be right now for my team. That's something different. We want to focus on Treasury specific. That's not for my organization as a whole. And ultimately I'm not.

Nicholas Westburg   35:37
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   35:46
We're not even at that level yet of focusing on the products and the areas we're at the base level. I definitely want to take it to that next level and say, OK, if I'm in cash application, well, how do I do it?

Nicholas Westburg   35:48
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   35:57
Well, I would take like the marketing or the newsletter play and now we reorient that and say here you need to build a prompt that's specific to your area. You need to get a news lead specific to your area.
But here's the foundation of it, right?
Let them worry about curating it to their unique space.
I'm trying to build a foundation and the tools that then can be can be used as a template somewhere else.

Nicholas Westburg   36:17
Yeah.
So another thing too that I left out, and I've always I've wanted to get better at this.
I'm not good at talking to a camera through a laptop, just how I am.
People are really good.
I love visually watching somebody go through a process and do whatever it is that they're doing.

Peter Wolf   36:37
Yeah. Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   36:39
Because that's how I learn rather than somebody had it written in, you know, like words and text.

Peter Wolf   36:44
Yes, I have.
I have a loom.
I have a loom subscription.

Nicholas Westburg   36:47
So.

Peter Wolf   36:48
I don't know if you've seen that a lot of the a lot of the bloggers or people on YouTube use that.
So you see the screen they're working on, and then you got a little round image and you can move it around the screen, but you can be showing your screen and you can be talking at the same time so.

Nicholas Westburg   36:54
Yeah.
I think if we do like 4 videos a I don't know four videos a week of us. Like you said, for example going to YouTube and pulling the transcript and then giving it a certain prompt and kind of just walking through like, hey, this is, you know, me.

Peter Wolf   37:04
I.

Nicholas Westburg   37:16
Demoing. You know how I approach this process or how I'm?

Peter Wolf   37:20
I.
I love it.

Nicholas Westburg   37:21
I don't you know.

Peter Wolf   37:23
I think again what what I would, what I would focus on is first getting together the content that we think is valuable and then also I wouldn't go build a instruction video when one already exists out in YouTube world where we could already take it right now on.

Nicholas Westburg   37:30
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   37:40
Building stuff specific to more specific to us, like writing a custom GBT, but we wanna do it for prompting in our area or something like that. I think making our own right, making our own might make sense.

Bryan Wolf   37:53
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   37:56
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   37:59
I try and work on this other stuff.
This link this stuff in my make is all is my my my my make thing is all jacked up.

Nicholas Westburg   38:02
What are you Brian?
What are you working on right now? Hello.

Bryan Wolf   38:07
I'm gonna try and fix it, but right now I'm trying to work on.

Peter Wolf   38:11
All right.

Bryan Wolf   38:11
Two of the yeah.

Peter Wolf   38:12
But you guys have path forward, right?
Again, don't feel pressure on the time thing.

Nicholas Westburg   38:14
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   38:16
Let's just start filling it in finding the best stuff we got. Then we'll go back through the list and we'll figure out, OK, again, transcripts, URLs.
Then we'll do the kind of loading transcripts, get summaries, include those, and then maybe we really should come up with a format, a prompt format.
So when you give me a YouTube video summary, we should have a consistent format for everyone that we do so that we know that someone goes into our repository and always gets the same.

Nicholas Westburg   38:41
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   38:42
Here's the main header.
Here's the five key points.
Here's the conclusion. What you should walk away with.
So we should come up with that prompt and actually I'm sure there's prompts out there actually on that.
Interesting. I think I just saw on the Today or yesterday on that superhuman was actually a thing, a prompt for getting the most out of an article or a YouTube video or something.
So I already have one that's written.
But it was written more for kind of educational like college, you know, I mean.
Well, of course, but I assume you could use that on that. When I send that over to you and then you guys can figure out if that's a good one to use or not. I'm sure I can find that.
As a foundation.
But I think we should find some consistent structure if we're going to do a summary on YouTube videos, we should have the same structure every time, right?

Nicholas Westburg   39:31
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   39:31
OK, alright.

Peter Wolf   39:31
That's gonna make it much more consumable.

Nicholas Westburg   39:33
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   39:33
OK.
All right, guys, talk to you.

Nicholas Westburg   39:38
Have a good one, Brian, if you wanna.

Bryan Wolf   39:40
I'll stay.

Nicholas Westburg   39:40
I know you're working on that flow.

Bryan Wolf   39:41
I'll stay out.

Nicholas Westburg   39:42
I also meant to ask you about that.
What API did you send?
Brave or something?

Bryan Wolf   39:49
Did I send one for brevrevo?

Nicholas Westburg   39:51
Yeah. Would it brave or brave though?
I guess I missed that meeting.

Bryan Wolf   39:54
When did I send that?

Nicholas Westburg   39:58
Bravo or bravo.

Bryan Wolf   40:00
I did.
I send that outbrevo Avi kid. This is me.
Yeah. So, Brevo, it's it's part of, it's a part of the.

Nicholas Westburg   40:03
Team.

Bryan Wolf   40:08
Workflow for the newsletter that Lem's making that he so he tried to present to us Monday and my dad went to a class.

Nicholas Westburg   40:13
Is it brave?

Bryan Wolf   40:15
BREVO beat Brevo and it's just one of the functions that we're gonna have to have inside the.

Nicholas Westburg   40:17
Hope rebound.
E-mail marketing.
E-mail marketing.

Bryan Wolf   40:24
The.

Nicholas Westburg   40:28
Workflow.

Bryan Wolf   40:29
Yeah, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   40:38
Oh my.
Yeah, definitely bang this out.
I'm not working right now.

Bryan Wolf   40:52
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   40:54
Looks like dog.

Bryan Wolf   40:54
I I'm gonna. I'm gonna contribute to it after the sale.
I'm trying to figure out.

Nicholas Westburg   40:57
****.
Yeah, do your thing.
I like working on this.
I take a lot longer.
So ******* rip it up. Do whatever you want to do with it.
I'll probably have like a zillion other copies.

Bryan Wolf   41:06
I bet.

Nicholas Westburg   41:06
But yeah, like, yeah, just me. I mean, I'm gonna just ******* tear through it. Much as I can.

Bryan Wolf   41:12
Maybe even e-mail Pete.
I am Pete.
Must be useless, but you have an hour.

Nicholas Westburg   41:17
Now I'll shoot Peter.
I just don't know if his work work schedule.

Bryan Wolf   41:20
It is probably a bad time not because you can work until 9:00, so it's kind of ****** in the ****, you know.

Nicholas Westburg   41:27
Yeah.
I feel like beer beers and ******* sit now would be perfect just to let's just talk for hours and figure **** out.

Bryan Wolf   41:39
It's a nice weather day.
It's a nice weather day.

Nicholas Westburg   41:42
In general, I feel like we need to do that just like set up just like me or your dad peed.

Bryan Wolf   41:44
I'm down this weekend.
Maybe I'll come down there this weekend. I don't know.

Nicholas Westburg   41:49
No, your dad's gotta be there too.

Bryan Wolf   41:51
I know he does.
Yeah. Pete needs to be there as well, but yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   41:54
Just drink.
Have some beers, some wine.
Try it up on your on 3rd floor.

Bryan Wolf   42:01
Maybe this weekend?

Nicholas Westburg   42:01
And have fathom recording the whole time.

Bryan Wolf   42:04
All right. I'm gonna work on this 'cause. I have to.

Nicholas Westburg   42:09
Hey, I gotta get work done. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Same one.

Bryan Wolf   42:10
I gotta speak to the GPT right?

Nicholas Westburg stopped transcription
