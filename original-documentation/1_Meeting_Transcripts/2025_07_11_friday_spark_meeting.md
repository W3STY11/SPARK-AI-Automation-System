Yeah, yeah, yeah. So are are we like transferring all of this to like your Peter's make account or?

Bryan Wolf   3:00
Yeah, you know, um, yeah, why not? Let's do that. Yeah, just do that.
It is gonna be a short dilemma. I think it's just we'll do that, we'll go over it and then I don't really have anything else.

Lem   3:16
OK, no problem. Yeah. So have you. So did you like, follow through with a glide? Oh, right.

Bryan Wolf   3:16
For us to do, for us to work on, you know, and I haven't talked to Peter.
Yeah, we did. We did. We did. No. So I didn't use. I didn't use glide, I used.
I use this program called Softer which.

Lem   3:35
Oh, I see.

Bryan Wolf   3:37
Which worked great. And I got I did everything he wanted me to, which is nice. And Nick, Nick used Google Sheets and got the did the same thing, so.

Lem   3:40
Oh, nice.

Bryan Wolf   3:52
Um, Glybe is just.
I didn't feel like paying for it and I got more out of a free version on a different, uh on a different thing.

Lem   3:58
I see.
So.
It's like a soft softer. Oh OK, this one softer soft S of the IO oh, that's.

Bryan Wolf   4:08
Yeah, SOFTER.
So I just use that and but that worked out, you know?

Lem   4:15
It's nice.
Hmm.

Bryan Wolf   4:21
Let me just transfer this over.

Lem   4:22
Custom business software with that.
Oh, I see. Yeah. So this like opportunity. Yeah, there's like bar chart here. Then there's, yeah, this is actually good.
So this is for like, uh, internal business software, right? Yeah, I think.
It's pretty good. It's nice.

Bryan Wolf   4:44
Should I just?
What are we even? So does this even?
The record retrieval. Yeah, I know whenever you wanna start. Did you e-mail me? Can you e-mail me like I I don't have my dad's password, so get you on his account.

Lem   5:58
OK.

Bryan Wolf   6:02
That's like Tuesday morning, actually, because Monday's not even good.
Not even going to be around. I also don't have anything for you to work on.

Lem   6:15
So I I'll just send you the like the.

Bryan Wolf   6:19
Yeah, just send me the the close to Jason and.

Lem   6:21
Jason and.
OK. And yeah, I I also not sure. Yeah, maybe we could later you could share your screen because there's like like.

Bryan Wolf   6:27
I hate you. What else do I need?
Yeah.

Lem   6:40
Some input variables on the Jason's, but I think it would pass through. I'll just uh.

Bryan Wolf   6:45
But it was.

Lem   6:47
Yeah, uh, let me just save this one.

Bryan Wolf   6:49
Alright, but.

Lem   6:52
Yeah, so I'll just send you the full prompt and then.

Bryan Wolf   6:53
Mm.

Lem   6:59
Um.

Bryan Wolf   6:59
Listen now.

Lem   7:01
Yeah.
Um.
So I.
Uh.
Uh.
Full prompt.
OK. And then the chase on.

Bryan Wolf   7:39
Oh.
Um.
What databases?

Lem   8:00
Sorry.

Bryan Wolf   8:16
He.

Lem   8:29
Oops.

Bryan Wolf   8:33
They them also when when usually work for clients they they give you like their sheets password their.

Lem   8:41
Yeah, for other one other clients they are comfortable giving me their like Gmail temporarily and then for others they just like for Google Sheets they like a shared drive. They yeah they they invite me to like a shared drive.

Bryan Wolf   8:50
Yeah.
Copy paste what we do.
Oh, OK.
They don't trust you, love.

Lem   9:02
Yep, that's much. Because, yeah, it's much easier. Yeah, it's much. Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   9:04
I'm just kidding. Yeah, it is easier. I I kind of like how I'm learning a little bit, you know, at least.

Lem   9:13
Yep.
Uh.
Surely.
But for example the other client that is like he also like he has an agency and then he just outsource me like if he the automations that his client needs.

Bryan Wolf   9:37
Yeah.

Lem   9:43
And yeah, I I have like a personal e-mail, so it's like straightforward. So all of the accounts are connected.

Bryan Wolf   9:51
So you don't you don't usually keep most of the automations you make then, do you?
Great, great, great, great. See how the house.

Lem   10:07
Yes, saving the files then, but yeah, some of the commissions.

Bryan Wolf   10:10
What's the flow to be built? What other type of automation do you build?

Lem   10:14
Mostly more on like the CRM like onboarding process flows like for example like what I'm I'm currently working on like integrating Click up, Slack, Google sheet and.

Bryan Wolf   10:29
Slag.

Lem   10:30
What's again type form. So basically it's like an onboarding process and also panda doc. It's like an onboarding process of their clients from from for example signing the panda doc documents. So it's like the contract and then they're paying.
They already paid and then it's like a onboarding process from day one to like day five. They have like a strategy development something. So it's basically it's just sending data and then sending notification to the the assignee, the strategist and then something like that and then updating the click up CRM.
Then updating the task, so something like that. So the main issue, yeah the main challenge should be like the logic of the. For example if the client gives you gives you the scope, so you need to like outline the logic or how would you structure like the system on it. So basically that's the.

Bryan Wolf   11:09
Yeah.
OK.

Lem   11:26
The challenging part on it, but Yep, so let me just yeah, 12345.
OK, yeah, so I also changed the name to Task one, Task two, Task three, so that it would be easier to.
Um.
And then Yep, OK, just sent you the Jason files and also the full prompt of the agent.

Bryan Wolf   13:08
Wow, this is a big problem.
Big problem. Yeah, let me.

Lem   13:48
Database. Yeah, just use the GPT 40 because it's yeah, the prompt is kinda long, so we need.

Bryan Wolf   13:54
Those sucks.
Now, is this the prompt that you sent me that I put here? I put the big one here.

Lem   13:59
Nope, it's already it's updated, so we have 5 tasks on this prompt, so it's quite long.

Bryan Wolf   14:07
So what should I put here for just be like you are?

Lem   14:09
The yeah, the whole prompt the you put here on the system prompt.
Uh, Yep, that's right. Just copy and paste it and then click save.
Yep, so that's OK. And then the next thing here would be to import the Jason. Yeah, so just import Nope on.

Bryan Wolf   14:33
Can I do it through here? I don't do it through here.

Lem   14:38
Yeah, we need to import it through creating scenarios. So just I think, yeah, this you can put it on this one on this folder so that it would be more organized then yeah, should input it 1 by 1.
Task one.
OK, so um.

Bryan Wolf   15:04
So I don't have. So here's the thing though is that I don't. I don't have a.

Lem   15:05
OK, that's good.
Oh, right, the Google sheet. So I forgot.

Bryan Wolf   15:09
I don't know what data. Yeah, and I don't think he, um, just put him in it.
So what I'm going to do for the time being?

Lem   15:16
Yeah, I I need. I forgot. Yeah, I forgot to send you the share link for the database. So let me just.

Bryan Wolf   15:22
Well, those are just the temporary ones that you have or or those is.

Lem   15:25
Yeah, that's right, temporary ones, but if like the columns or would be different, so we would need to edit all of the input data here on the automations. So that's actually.

Bryan Wolf   15:27
Yeah, they're just free temporary.
Problem.

Lem   15:40
But yeah, I'll I'll just send you also if the so that maybe and if he wants to test it out also or something sent.

Bryan Wolf   15:50
I think by probably when he comes back, probably have to change the rows to fit like you're you're saying like the stuff inside of here is like.

Lem   15:59
Yeah, so.
Yeah, the the ones like the dynamic variables there. So we would need to change them also if we change the columns because it's all it's actually synced with the also with the prompt, it's all synced the columns and the.

Bryan Wolf   16:15
We're just going to have to wait for a week.

Lem   16:18
Yeah, it's sync the columns and the prompt and also the input dynamic variables here on the the automations.
But Yep.
And then we we you would need to change also the trigger for this one. So it should be yeah, that one should be on demand. Yeah, this one. So it will. The AI agent will be the one who will like.

Bryan Wolf   16:57
Right in here.

Lem   17:09
Then you need to activate also the scenario so that yeah, we could pull it out on.

Bryan Wolf   17:12
How you doing? OK.

Lem   17:18
Yeah, I think it needs the Google sheet. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   17:23
Does.
Can we just use yours? Let's just use yours.

Lem   17:34
Um, but uh in the?

Bryan Wolf   17:35
Or did you did you send it to me? Oh, I thought you sent it to me.

Lem   17:38
Yeah, I, uh, sent you the.

Bryan Wolf   17:39
That's OK. It's OK. Oh, Google Docs. Yeah, you did.

Lem   17:45
Editor.

Bryan Wolf   17:47
Wasn't there two of them now?

Lem   17:50
Um, yeah, yeah. There's, uh, two sheets on this on this spreadsheet. So there's actually.
To.

Bryan Wolf   18:01
Oh, I see. I see.

Lem   18:49
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   19:27
Just shared it with me.

Lem   19:31
Yeah, I think you need to click the link first. Yeah, this one. The test database. Yeah, make a copy.
OK.
Yeah, this should work. Copy of test.
Yeah, we need to reauthorize this I think on the connections, but yeah, you could just unlink it for now and click save. So and then can you click the turn it on so that we could pull it out on the.
Yeah, this one just turned. Yeah, Yep, that's right. Then yeah, we could now import also the other ones, the task 234, the 2G2 to five.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   21:02
Got a dog on?

Lem   21:10
OK, uh.
Save. Yep, it's good. And then yeah, we oh oh, we need to change the trigger for this. Can you go back? Yeah, so we need to change it to also to on demand.
So yeah, on demand. OK, save. OK, activate. Yeah, that's good.
Yeah.
Um, Yep. And then.
Last tree.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   22:03
Isn't this the same one?

Lem   22:05
No, this is actually a different one. So yeah, the the like the structure is the same, but this is pulling out from.
The.

Bryan Wolf   22:20
Reaction the second sheet instead of the first sheet.

Lem   22:22
Yeah, the second sheet, the interaction, last interaction sheet.
Then OA later we could just edit the task tree. I think we need to also the trigger should be.

Bryan Wolf   22:55
I changed it already.

Lem   22:57
Oh, right. Oh, I just lagged. I thought it was.

Bryan Wolf   23:03
I don't actually, actually.

Lem   23:04
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   23:18
This isn't gonna work there.

Lem   23:20
Yeah, so can you change also the trigger? Yeah, to on demand. Then you could turn this on. Activate. OK.

Bryan Wolf   23:32
How do I go back and do videos?

Lem   23:38
The other one.

Bryan Wolf   23:41
Oh, how do I?
How do I refresh the connection?

Lem   23:46
Yeah, I'll show it to you like later. It's just on the we have like a section here also on the left side that's.
Uh, for the connection update.
Task three. It's OK. It's already on demand. I think task four can check the task four. OK, yeah, so you could turn the all the automations here.
For the.
Oh, we need to. Yeah, right. We need to 1st to.

Bryan Wolf   24:51
Google.

Lem   24:53
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   24:54
To do that, I forget what you said.

Lem   24:55
OK, so let's go on the more, just click more and then there's connections. Yeah, this one, the first one. Yeah. Then on the Peter. Yeah, P9 Wolf, you could just verify. Yeah, reauthorize.
So you could click the reauthorize.

Bryan Wolf   25:13
Which one are restricted?

Lem   25:15
Yeah, this one. I know the the, yeah, that one because it has like 25 scenarios. So I think this is the one that is being connected.

Bryan Wolf   25:16
This one or this one?

Lem   25:24
P9 OK.
So.
OK, so that's good then.
Uh.
Check there.
Yeah, this should work.
Oh, it's the Google restricted.
Uh huh. That's odd.

Bryan Wolf   25:54
Fresh chickens.

Lem   25:56
Uh, yes. So maybe it's the other one, I think.

Bryan Wolf   26:00
I don't know it's got 20 something.

Lem   26:02
Yeah, we could just go back to the connections and then.
Uh, change the Google restricted of. Yeah, this one reauthorized. Uh.
Continue.
Oh, this is on Gmail.
Uh, let's try it again.
OK, so that part that's good.
Uh, OK.
Uh, I think it's on Google Sheets. The next. Yeah, the next Google Sheets.
So, OK, I think that's good. So now I just turn on. Yeah, turn them on. Then you could now go back to the AI agent and then.

Bryan Wolf   27:53
That's a but wait, I didn't create it I guess.

Lem   27:57
Pardon.

Bryan Wolf   27:57
See where it oh database points are here.

Lem   28:00
Yeah, so yeah, yeah, below, as you can see, there's like system tools. So you could click the add, yeah, add and then just search for yeah, this one, yeah, the task. And then yeah, you would need the description for this one, so.
Oh, right. So the description is actually not being passed. So let me just send you the descriptions of this particular. Yeah, I'll just. I can send it on the chat. Let me just check it.

Bryan Wolf   28:28
He's running a child.

Lem   28:36
Uh.
Task one. So just copy and paste this one on the oops.
Uh.
So this is for task one. Just copy and paste all of them. So including the task one also and then task 2.
This one task 3.
Ask for.
Task 5 OK, yeah. So basically the description is very important because ChatGPT will read this particular description also so that it will know what tool to or what task to.

Bryan Wolf   29:34
Can I change the? Can I change the? Put three or?

Lem   29:35
2.
Um.
Yeah, you could. We could change it later.

Bryan Wolf   29:44
Oh, later. OK, OK.

Lem   29:46
Yeah, just just add it first. And yeah, there's there would be like an edit button after.
Um.

Bryan Wolf   30:06
I just did that right here. I just pressed it. Yeah.

Lem   30:12
Just glitch. Uh, just click save first.
Click save on the upper right side. Yeah. And then maybe we refresh it sometimes. Oh, it didn't save. That's odd. Yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   30:31
OK.

Lem   30:32
Yeah, so the description is also just click the check marks on the right side. Yeah, yeah, you could also do that one. And then Yep, then click add. So let's see if actually, yeah, we can change it. So that's the task for, OK.

Bryan Wolf   30:32
Yes.
I changed the switches.

Lem   30:50
So as you can see, there's like on task four. Yeah, this one just change the plan.
OK.
Yep, I think that's good.
Then yeah, now you could test it out using the data here. So just there are like several similar names here also so that we could like test the like the.
Intelligence of the.
Search BT.
Yep. OK, so it's pulling out the.
Zoe Jones.
Um.

Bryan Wolf   33:29
Oh.
And I'm not going to push this thing to its limits, I think.
And I don't really have anything else for you to do, yeah.
I don't see.
See if I can.
Is it Friday?

Lem   33:56
Pardon.

Bryan Wolf   33:56
Friday. It's Friday, right? You got a wedding tomorrow?

Lem   33:58
Yeah, it's Friday.

Bryan Wolf   34:01
Maybe we just won't give you anything to do. Plus, do you want something to do?

Lem   34:02
Um, yeah.
Um, yeah, it would be also good so that I could, uh, do like a Buterest.

Bryan Wolf   34:12
Yeah, why not? Let's just leave it at that. And then uh.
Monday.
Well, one day we just won't even meet then. Let's see if I can just see my jacket. I mean, whatever. I I'll get contact Pete if he wants to send you an e-mail or something. He will. It's not. He's on vacation too, so he might not land, you know what I mean?

Lem   34:36
OK, yeah, so yeah, but because I think this would wouldn't be like the final final system because.

Bryan Wolf   34:37
Um.
Alright, but yeah, I guess I'll see you one day. I don't have anything else.
Copy. Yeah, keep working on it, whatever.

Lem   34:50
Yeah, and no, like Peter has like different information right on his like contacts. So I think we would need to change the prompts here and also for example the columns. So, but basically this is just like the test data for now. So yeah, we would need to change a lot.

Bryan Wolf   34:51
We needed sheets.
Yeah.
Yeah, you know what? I'll I'll shoot him a message. I'll shoot him a message to send me those sheets. If I get them, I'll send them to you and then you can work on this more if you want, right?

Lem   35:11
OK.
Oh, OK. Yeah, that that would actually be, yeah, that would be helpful. So that we could, yeah, we could change the prompts and other things. OK.

Bryan Wolf   35:23
Alright, cool.
I love. I'm gonna get off. I'll call. You're the man then. Hey, have fun at your wedding. Have fun at your wedding. You know, hopefully. Hopefully you look dapper. Maybe send some pictures. You look really handsome in your suit. You know what I mean?
