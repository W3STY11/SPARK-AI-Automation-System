Uh, yeah, on the.

Bryan Wolf   1:59
The newsletter.

Lem   2:01
Yeah. So I actually added the the first automation.
So like the inbox, right?
Research inbox and then I've connected all it also to the like the newsletter. So it yeah. So basically if you want to add some like customized.

Bryan Wolf   2:16
Hello.

Lem   2:23
Not coming from RSS.
The RSS feeds, so yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   2:26
Right. Like our own, yeah.

Lem   2:28
So basically you can just e-mail yourself an e-mail the link and then just put subject line as research. Then it will yeah it will add it to the spreadsheet that we'll just so I will.

Bryan Wolf   2:35
Nice.

Lem   2:40
Yeah, I'll explain it later on the flow.

Bryan Wolf   2:44
OK, great.

Lem   2:45
Umm.
Yep, so.
Are we good or?

Bryan Wolf   3:03
Yeah. I mean, we're me and you are good.

Lem   3:04
There's still.

Bryan Wolf   3:05
I don't know if we're good to go.

Lem   3:09
OK.
I'll just I think I can.
Do this later updated, but yeah, the for the newsletter flow it's already.
Good. So I've updated it to the one that.
Peter requested.
So let me just share my screen, then I'll send you guys this Jason.
Allowed to or do you?
I think I can.
Send it now so that you guys can like or yeah.

Bryan Wolf   3:37
Sure. Yeah.
Follow along. Yeah, I don't send send no send.
No, I like like look at it maybe.
I keep up. Yeah. Cool.

Lem   3:45
I'll send it now to you guys.
OK, so I'll send it to you guys.
So let me just go to your.
Oh, right now.
1st.
Haven't exported it yet.
Explore.
OK.
So yeah, right now we already have 5 flows, but yeah, so it's OK because it's much simpler.

Bryan Wolf   4:17
Mm hmm.

Lem   4:22
We would only.

Bryan Wolf   4:23
Wait, it's five floors for the newsletter.

Lem   4:24
Be.
Yeah, it's five floors, but it it's all connected by web book, so it's it's good.

Bryan Wolf   4:28
OK.

Lem   4:32
So that's the one Peter requested.
So basically.

Bryan Wolf   4:35
So is it 5 different Jason files or just it's one Jason file?

Lem   4:38
Yeah, it's five different Jason files and it's all connected together.

Bryan Wolf   4:41
File. There we go.

Lem   4:45
By the like the spreadsheet trigger.

Bryan Wolf   4:47
The weather, OK. OK.

Lem   4:48
Yeah. So so it's connected via the spreadsheet triggers.
I'm just exporting all it all.
Oh, it's only four.
My bad.
So the fifth one is like the first flow, like the inbox inbox filter.

Bryan Wolf   5:05
Yeah.

Lem   5:06
So yeah, so that.
But basically it's yeah, it's only for.
Yep.
My bad.
Yeah. So it's only four and then the fifth one is we could connect the like the inbox.
We just have to tweak it a little bit.
But yeah, let me just send you guys first. This 4 Jason files, the newest one for the.
Newsletter flow.
So now we can edit the articles that we could choose.
I mean, yeah.
I mean, we could add the articles that we want and then we could also like edit the.
Edit it and.

Peter Wolf   5:46
Are you sharing your screen?

Lem   5:49
Not yet.
I'm sending you guys the Jason.
Let me just plug.
Uh.
OK. And then I'll explain it.
Yep, I send it so now I'll.
Share my screen and.
Just.
Uh, share the screen.
OK.
So yeah, so basically we now have 4 flows. So this fifth one is just I'm connecting the like the we have the e-mail inbox, right.
So we could actually connect that one and put it on a spreadsheet.
So now we I also added a new spreadsheet which is the filtered articles.
So now we have the all articles, so this is just updating every 8:00 AM from inoreeder.
And then the filtered articles is being filtered by ChatGPT.
And then we could add here like manually add here like a title or like a article and then a summary, and then we could also connect this one to the like the inbox. The first flow that I that I built, the one that is researching the the e-mail.
Inbox and then subject line research, then yeah. Then. Now after every 8:00 AM there's.

Peter Wolf   7:05
Yep.

Lem   7:11
Would be like all articles here, right?
And then it would update also here on the here on the.
Yeah. On the filtered articles. And then what we will do now is we could actually now choose to include and then when we click yes.

Peter Wolf   7:27
Yep.
Yep.

Lem   7:31
So we could just.
We could just click yes here anywhere, so the trigger would be that one.
So anywhere, let's say I'll choose this like four articles.
So like we've tested, we've read the commentary and then we'll like the commentary.

Peter Wolf   7:47
Yep.

Lem   7:49
So now we could just trigger anywhere here. Let's say here. Yes. So this is actually connected to the automation.
So what will happen there is we would have another.
Another row here, which is on the newsletter drafts and then we would have like the folder here and then these would be like empty as you can see the same as this one.
So it's empty.
So the next step for us is to review the particular content made by ChatGPT and then now we. If it's all good like we we edited it and stuff and it's now good.
So we could trigger now the the CS button.
So what will happen is it will trigger again as a web book on the another automation and then it will push test e-mail to ourself to our Gmail and then it will put here sent and then what will happen is we now we could check our e-mail so.
For example, if tested this from end to end, now we could actually check this one. So as you can see this this is the emails or task newsletter it would.
Be like this?
There would be a test because my e-mail is on the test list, so I will explain that.
Yeah. So now we can see the output.
So the output is OK.
So if we're already good with the output, we can go back to the our spreadsheet and then click again here, send final newsletter to Bravo.
Click yes.
So what this will do?
Is it will send the e-mail to our list so that would be like the last step. Then it will update here the date which is where? Yeah when did we send?

Peter Wolf   9:24
Newsletter date Yep.

Lem   9:26
The Yep, that's right.
So yeah, basically that's the whole flow.
We would only be opening this particular spreadsheet for that one so.
1st we would choose here and then next is we would. It would appear here on our Google Doc and then yeah, it would appear here. And then yeah, we could test e-mail.
So if the formatting is correct and then now we could if the formatting is good on our e-mail, we could now send it directly here.
So we we won't.
We won't be needing to check our bravo, so all of it is already here.
On the spreadsheet so.

Peter Wolf   10:00
Because in that Google Doc link we could edit in the Google Doc link.

Lem   10:04
Yep, that's right.
Yeah. So we can add it here.
The the like content so the subsection content we could add this one.
Then you could also yeah, the conclusion say also added a conclusion now.
So there's a conclusion below and then as you can see here, yeah, this one.
So there's the subsections and there. There's a conclusion below.

Peter Wolf   10:26
Yep.

Lem   10:27
And yeah, for this instead.

Peter Wolf   10:27
OK.
So let me let me just.
Let's let's go.
Let me just show you something real quick, 'cause. I think it looks like you've already incorporated this stuff that I definitely was looking for.

Lem   10:35
OK.

Peter Wolf   10:40
Let me just show you this real quick and then.
You can.
We can walk through your flow, but.

Lem   10:48
OK.

Peter Wolf   10:50
Here.
Yeah. OK.
All right, so I took a flows and I mean I think you ended up you're pretty much where I'm where I was again.
We were talking yesterday, but as I was thinking about it last night, I so here's the standard flow, right?

Lem   11:11
Yep.

Peter Wolf   11:14
Get the articles from the Ino reader, search for duplicates.

Lem   11:17
Yep.

Peter Wolf   11:18
Create the UUID, put them in a data sheet and that's really just the URL and the the the the summary from the inner reader and.
And the title.
Right. Or I think we add category or something like that, maybe I'm not sure.

Lem   11:32
Yeah, that's right. Yep.
On.

Peter Wolf   11:36
That puts them all into a bundle.
Now what I was thinking here, and maybe we're we're shifting.
When we look through your flow, we'll determine whether this makes sense or not.
I was thinking that what you're doing is now populating this stuff into this sheet, right?
And we can edit at this point to decide what goes in.

Lem   11:56
Yes, that's right.

Peter Wolf   11:59
I was thinking.

Lem   11:59
Yep, yeah.

Peter Wolf   12:03
Yeah, that's that's that's after it does this selection of the top articles right 'cause then you're feeding it into the the the spreadsheet because you you're doing this choose top three because you have that little blurb with the commentary.

Lem   12:09
Uh.

Peter Wolf   12:20
So obviously it's after this you have here the spreadsheet again. No can we?

Lem   12:22
No.
No, not yet.

Peter Wolf   12:25
Let's walk through your let's walk through your float, OK?

Lem   12:26
Yeah. So the first step would be the the first summary is actually coming from the INA reader, so.

Peter Wolf   12:35
OK. Can you can you go back to sharing and then we'll just look at each step and then?

Lem   12:37
Oh, right, yeah.
Uh, share.

Peter Wolf   12:41
Hey Brae is is Nick joining or is he coming here today do you know?

Bryan Wolf   12:45
I don't know.
I think in the mornings it's kind of hard for them to make these because work.

Peter Wolf   12:49
OK.

Lem   12:52
Yeah. So this is the flow.
I've just added and I've edited it a little and like put here the image.

Peter Wolf   12:58
Yep. So let's just walk through it again.

Lem   13:00
Yeah. So the first one is actually getting the summary from the yeah, it's getting first. The art every 8:00 AM it's getting the new new articles from our. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   13:09
Let's say the new batch.
UN unrestricted batch right? Unrestricted batch OK.

Lem   13:14
Yeah, the new batch.
So this is the new batch and then it's all feeding it to the searching for a duplicate 1st and then next is it will yeah create a UUID and then it will assign a photo.

Peter Wolf   13:22
Yep.

Lem   13:28
So if there's already a photo, it won't be getting the Unsplash. And then we're putting it all on the all articles.

Peter Wolf   13:29
Yeah.
OK.
So now at this point what we have is the is the URL, the summary from the Eno reader, the the image, and the UUID now publication date.

Lem   13:36
Yeah. So.
Yep, this one.
Yep, Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   13:48
Right now that's confusing.
That would be like extraction date really right now, right?

Lem   13:52
The publication date is the date published, so it's also coming here from Inoreader there's.

Peter Wolf   13:57
Yeah, so extraction extraction date or no published date. You're saying from the article when the article's actual date?

Lem   14:01
No Publix.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, it's the actual date was was published.

Peter Wolf   14:05
OK.
So the article might have been picked up today, but it might have been from two days ago or something.

Lem   14:09
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yep. That's right.

Peter Wolf   14:09
So the date of the actual article OK.

Lem   14:13
Yep. And then after that one is we would get the persona and then the ChatGPT will choose like the.

Peter Wolf   14:19
Well, hold on.
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.
So when they when we put them all into the into the Google sheet, now we got the image got all that stuff.

Lem   14:29
Yep.

Peter Wolf   14:30
Here's where I have.
Here's where I have the issue is I want to have a manual input to get to that Google sheet.
So I think that this point, yeah.

Lem   14:41
No, this is.
This is just choosing.
Actually it's not creating yet the content, so it's just choosing filter because we have like the all articles here right then yeah.

Peter Wolf   14:52
OK, right.
So I'm sorry, the first sheet is the unfiltered.
Then you go and you're now filtering down to the ones that would be worthwhile.

Lem   14:56
Yeah, yeah.
Filtered. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   15:01
OK.
I'm sorry. Go back to your go back to your sheet.

Lem   15:02
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, so here.
So this is the like. All articles would be put here and then ChatGPT will put the top three or top five depending on our our what we want.

Peter Wolf   15:09
Yep.

Lem   15:15
So this is already filtered one and then we could add the articles manually here if we want or like the one from coming from our inbox.
So because you wanted to like let's say you want an article, right?
Like you want to manually add here.

Peter Wolf   15:30
Yeah, that's what I was.
That's where my flow is.
I have that we're gonna use the Gmail input instead of using the word research.

Lem   15:35
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   15:37
Maybe we'll put newsletter plus and that would be the keyword and then you would populate this and and Yep, do the exact same thing.

Lem   15:39
Yep.
Yep. Yes, that's right, yeah.

Peter Wolf   15:45
You'd essentially act like it was an inner reader feed and put it in.

Lem   15:48
Yep.

Peter Wolf   15:49
The only problem is.
It needs to be after the selection one, because at the point when I'm putting it in, I'm saying I want it in.
It's not in the draft space, right?
This is already saying.
That I defensively want it in, right?
Or it needs to be in the the ones I get to choose from?

Lem   16:06
Yeah, because this is actually updating every 8:00 AM.
And then if we would be only posting like once once a week on our newsletter, you would actually have like plenty of plenty of data here.
Like plenty of the the one to choose from.

Peter Wolf   16:21
Yep.

Lem   16:24
So the one that I've actually designed it that you would just be choosing here and not on the like all articles, because this would actually like populate too much.
There would be like hundreds of articles here.
Here. So this one is already filtered and you could just like check this like one day one or like and then add some if you want.
So that's basically because if we would be adding it here.
Yeah, it would.
Does that make sense?
This is actually populating every day every 8:00 AM.

Peter Wolf   17:00
Yep.

Lem   17:01
Yeah, there's a new like let's say.

Peter Wolf   17:02
Well, well, hold on.
Let's go look back at the order. The first you you, the the newsletter drafts, OK.
So let's start all the way back, right?

Lem   17:10
Yep.

Peter Wolf   17:11
So first we get the Ino reader, it populates into, it looks for duplicates.

Lem   17:13
Yep.

Peter Wolf   17:16
It hasn't populated anything.
Gives it a UUID. Gets an image for it.
And or as a new custom image and then it puts all the articles. So show me which tab you're doing right at that step.
Put all artists which tab are you looking at?

Lem   17:28
This one.

Peter Wolf   17:31
Yeah. When you populate which ones in the spreadsheet OK.

Lem   17:32
This one, so this would populate all the articles.

Peter Wolf   17:34
So can we put a one on that?
Can we put a in the name?
Just put a one period in the tab name tab name.
Just rename the tab and just put one.

Lem   17:41
Tab here.
What it's this.

Peter Wolf   17:46
You right click, right click and change the name rename.
Yep, right click or drag it to the left, right.

Lem   17:51
OK, this one.

Peter Wolf   17:54
Rename.
Oh, no. Do you need that because you you use that in your reference, right?

Lem   17:56
Rename.
Yeah, yeah, we this is.

Peter Wolf   18:03
OK. But can you move the tab all the way to the left then and make it drag it to the left so that I see this the first one we go to 'cause. It's a little confusing.
They're out of order in what we execute.

Lem   18:13
Yeah, I actually added it here because this is like just a database.
So if because this is like the main user interface like this, two of this one.
But yeah, I can.

Peter Wolf   18:23
I understand, but I'm trying to think. Yeah, exactly.
So now I know that's the first one.

Lem   18:26
Yeah. OK. OK, yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   18:27
That's the unfiltered tab, right?

Lem   18:29
Ah, OK.

Peter Wolf   18:29
That's all articles coming from Inoreader. OK, so we're not really ever gonna look at that one because the system is gonna select from that list for us, right?

Lem   18:30
OK.
Yeah. Yeah. Yep, that's OK. Yeah.
So this is the first one.
Yep. Yeah, that's right. Yep.

Peter Wolf   18:39
So we're really not looking at that one. OK, now go back to your go back to your flow.

Lem   18:42
Yeah.
OK.

Peter Wolf   18:45
OK.
So now we're on.

Lem   18:47
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   18:47
That's that's it.
That's tab 1, right?
That put all articles.

Lem   18:50
Yep.

Peter Wolf   18:51
That's tab #1. Then we go.

Lem   18:53
Yeah, this is.

Peter Wolf   18:54
Yep. Then then it gets sent to.

Lem   18:55
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   18:58
Put all the data into a bundle so it's just consolidating them.
There could be 10.
There could be 100 whatever.
Get the persona and then send it to GPT and it says pick the best ones here for me, right?

Lem   19:08
Yep.
Yep, that's right. Yep.

Peter Wolf   19:12
Now the iterator.
What's the iterator doing here?

Lem   19:16
Because the results here also are multiple. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   19:17
OK.
The whole bunch is three articles coming out OK and then now.
So that's the iterator.
Then you're aggregating, right?
Then you're putting them into the Sprite, or you're searching for the UUID and you're adding back, yeah.

Lem   19:29
Yeah, this is just a delay.
Because sometimes there's a delay. Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   19:33
OK.
So you're one at a time iterating and putting them in.

Lem   19:36
So we we don't need to aggregate this one.
It's just putting 1 by 1 to the. Yeah, so yeah.

Peter Wolf   19:39
Yeah.
OK.
So 1 by 1 it puts it in. Now to tab #2, right?

Lem   19:45
Yeah, to tab #2 here in the filtered article.

Peter Wolf   19:47
So add filtered articles.

Lem   19:48
So it's already here.

Peter Wolf   19:49
This is tab #2, so now this is articles. Gpt says these are the best ones for you to use.

Lem   19:49
Yep, Yep.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   19:54
Now, here's my here's my view.
Go back over to your flows.

Lem   19:57
OK.
Here.

Peter Wolf   20:01
Right, so now all the way back to the left.
Here's where we're saying instead of the manual, you know the the the timed Ino. We're essentially gonna have a Gmail input right here, and it's gonna go through the exact same path right there.

Lem   20:11
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   20:18
We would have a new Gmail input that says if I have newsreader newsletter.
Plus it should come here and go right to that next step. The search for duplicates and then it would walk through all those steps and it would populate.

Lem   20:27
Yeah. Yeah, that's right. So actually.

Peter Wolf   20:31
But here it would only go through.
It wouldn't go to this.
Article put articles in TAB 1.
Step it would bypass that.

Lem   20:40
Yeah, it would bypass.
Yeah. Let me just.

Peter Wolf   20:42
Yeah. Can you can you just shrink your screen a little bit so I can take a shot and show you something?
Yeah, yeah.
Stop. Stop right there. That's good.

Lem   20:47
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   20:49
Hold on.

Lem   20:52
Yeah. So I actually connected like the first one that the like the e-mail inbox and then I actually connected it.
Here I can like show you if you. Yeah, let me just go back here. OK. So this was the one that I've built, right? The first one.

Peter Wolf   21:02
OK. Yeah.

Lem   21:09
So this is the research label Inbox.

Peter Wolf   21:12
Yep.

Lem   21:13
Yeah. So for this one you, we were just only pumping it.
I mean feeding it the article, so we would need to research it via perplexity.

Peter Wolf   21:23
Yeah.

Lem   21:23
Because yeah, we don't have the like the summary for it.
So basically it would be, yeah, yeah, that's right. So.

Peter Wolf   21:28
Oh, right. We don't have a summary, OK.
So you're essentially going to feed into perplexity and ask perplexity to give back the same thing the inner reader does.

Lem   21:33
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
So basically what we would change only here is the spreadsheet I spreadsheet.
So now we would connect it to the filtered articles and then we will put the title.

Peter Wolf   21:45
Right, so Tab 2, it doesn't go into tab one, it goes directly to Tab 2.

Lem   21:49
Yeah, it will.
Yeah. On the Tab 2 and then it will, yeah, feed the title and then the result and then the image URL. I haven't put it the like the Unsplash here because I think perplexity can't get the particular image URL. But I I would need to like prompt it.

Peter Wolf   21:51
OK.

Lem   22:06
If it can do that, but yeah, but yeah, I could test it out.

Peter Wolf   22:07
OK.
So if possible, you'll get the you'll get the image, but you still need to do that thing if no image exists, do the replacement right.

Lem   22:13
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, the Unsplash 1.
And then, yeah, basically this it's the same.
The one is we we just need like, yeah.

Peter Wolf   22:22
Perfect.

Lem   22:23
So it it it? Yeah.

Peter Wolf   22:24
OK, so perfect.
So that path you're gonna have the replacement of, you're gonna try and add image there. Get the image if there's no image, you do that replacement thing you already have. But at the end you end up populating in that in the Tab 2 Tab 2. OK, that's perfect.

Lem   22:30
Yep.
On top two. Yeah, that's right on top two.
So we would, yeah, we would have.

Peter Wolf   22:41
Yeah.

Lem   22:42
Yeah. The one that we chose, we would populate it here on Tab 2.
Yeah, Sir.

Peter Wolf   22:46
Yep. OK. And so now we've got all these articles out here now.

Lem   22:46
Then now we could.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   22:50
Tab 2 After I complete, if I select items and I push them further, they stay here and we change the status over here to sent or whatever right or process. OK so we could also put a filter on here and say don't show me ones that are already.

Lem   23:02
Processed, yeah.
Processed. Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   23:08
Processed so I don't have this list of 5000 items right?
I can put a filter on column on row one.

Lem   23:12
Umm.

Peter Wolf   23:15
It says don't show me processed items like a normal spreadsheet.

Lem   23:21
Yeah, I think we could like delete just hide them or something.

Peter Wolf   23:25
Yeah, isn't a normal spreadsheet feature here that you can just do.
I don't know how Google Sheets I'm used to excel, but can't you do a filter on on row one and say for column I status process you can hide?

Lem   23:31
Uh.
Yeah, I think we could have a formula for that that it will hide the ones processed, yeah.

Peter Wolf   23:42
OK, 'cause, at some point this is going to become massive, right?

Lem   23:42
I will just add.

Peter Wolf   23:45
We're not going to.
This will be could be thousands over time.
It could be thousands of articles, right?

Lem   23:50
Yep, yeah.

Peter Wolf   23:50
OK.
So at this point, we've got our Inno input and our manual input.

Lem   23:51
So we could hide that one there.
OK.

Peter Wolf   23:58
And with the status unprocessed now I say OK.
I want these five articles. Four of them were from the Inno One's from my manual input, right?

Lem   24:10
Yep, Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   24:11
OK. And then we say trigger the content, we say yes and we execute it right.

Lem   24:16
Yep.

Peter Wolf   24:18
And now it goes to. Now it goes where.

Lem   24:19
Yep.

Peter Wolf   24:21
Show me the process flow there or hold on, what's these other two lines?

Lem   24:23
So.

Peter Wolf   24:25
The other line in that process flow right there.
Back up to where you were the the the Gmail input.

Lem   24:28
Umm.

Peter Wolf   24:32
What was your second flow there?

Lem   24:32
This one.

Peter Wolf   24:33
What's that upper flow?

Lem   24:34
Oh, this one was for the Apple links.
Because you have. Yeah, the apple links, you can't get the. Yeah. Perplexity can't get a redirect URL.

Peter Wolf   24:38
Oh, right.
Yep, I remember.

Lem   24:45
But yeah.

Peter Wolf   24:45
Hey. Hey, guys.
Peter and Brian, guys, as we're going through this, if you're not understanding something, ask. OK, Peter.

Bryan Wolf   24:49
Yeah.
No, I'm tracking.

Peter Wolf   24:55
I'm not sure if you remember on this one. We had that second path because some of the articles it couldn't get to directly if they came from from Google Consolidator. Yeah, so.

Peter Wolf   25:02
Yeah, because of the apple feed, I I remember.

Peter Wolf   25:05
Or apple consolidator. OK, great.
So now we we got this low, we'll use a different word here instead of research.
So it goes to a different path.

Lem   25:12
Yep.

Peter Wolf   25:13
We say newsletter plus.

Lem   25:14
Yep. Newsletter.

Peter Wolf   25:14
And then that would be the trigger for Gmail to add it.
So now we have a yeah.

Bryan Wolf   25:17
So I got a question.

Lem   25:18
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   25:18
I got a question.
So now are we?
So this is already a flood that we have, are we just scrapping this flow and now utilizing for the newsletter or are we just gonna like, you know copy paste import no one that way we can still.

Peter Wolf   25:28
No, I think I think he's he's copied this. He's.

Bryan Wolf   25:31
Yeah. So but so that means we still have the other flow where it's like you type in research you know and it goes into your spreadsheet like I was trying to do for you last night, yeah.

Peter Wolf   25:35
Yeah, but this blow will just have a different name.
It would have a different name, right?

Lem   25:39
Yep. Because yeah. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   25:40
'Cause. It's gonna have something a little bit different when it puts it in the data sheet, it's gonna have different information.

Bryan Wolf   25:41
Yeah.
OK. OK, OK. Yeah, alright.

Peter Wolf   25:45
So he copied the flow, put it in.
Here we put a different word in than research we put in newsletter plus and it's got a slightly different flow, but he got the copy.

Lem   25:51
Yep.

Peter Wolf   25:53
This is what I'm saying when we start copying other chunks and bringing them in.

Bryan Wolf   25:53
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   25:57
This is, you know, he got to leverage this. Now he made some extra steps, but he got to leverage the whole top part and everything else, right.

Lem   26:04
Yep, yeah.

Peter Wolf   26:05
OK.
So this is great.

Lem   26:07
We just need to add some steps here for the image.

Peter Wolf   26:08
Yep, OK.

Lem   26:10
Actually, we are the one the steps here are that are missing are only for the image and like the publication date.

Bryan Wolf   26:17
Yeah.

Lem   26:17
So that's actually, but we we can actually put publication date as today here the the day-to-day that it extracted.

Peter Wolf   26:19
Yeah.

Lem   26:24
But yeah, I'll try to like.

Peter Wolf   26:25
Well, no, I would like it to have the publication date same as, so it's at least consistent, right?

Lem   26:28
Yep. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   26:29
If the article is from three days ago 'cause, I might be sending a manual one in that is from several days ago, right?

Lem   26:34
Yep, I just need to.

Peter Wolf   26:35
And it would be important to know what the date is.

Lem   26:37
Yeah, update the because yeah, the final output for this are only the title and the third the summary, so.
Yeah, I I think I we can also get the publication date there, but yeah. So for the next.

Peter Wolf   26:50
OK.

Bryan Wolf   26:51
OK.

Lem   26:52
So next is actually this one so.
Yeah.
Let me just, yeah, this one.
So basically we have 33 routes now because we've added a conclusion then.

Peter Wolf   27:11
Right. So the top route is the intro.

Lem   27:11
This.
Yeah, this is the intro and then this is the subsections.
Then for the bottom is the yeah, the conclusion.

Peter Wolf   27:17
And the bottom one is the conclusion.

Lem   27:21
The bottom is the conclusion.
Then yeah, it would.
The last step is it would create the Google Doc with all of the variables or all of the content.

Peter Wolf   27:30
OK, so at the bottom you have those two variables.
What they're doing is actually calling row one and row 2 right.

Lem   27:36
Yep. Row two. Yeah, that's right. Yep.

Peter Wolf   27:38
And then adding it to the row three and putting it all into the Google into the Google DOC newsletter, OK.

Lem   27:41
Yep.
Google doc.
Yep, that's right.
And then we we would be adding that all of the data to the tab tree. So the tab tree would be this one.
So now we would have the new newsletter graph created and then the Google Doc link and then this one would be empty.
So only two this two and also the document ID for referencing the feature.
But yeah, basically that.

Peter Wolf   28:06
Question should we be putting?

Bryan Wolf   28:06
OK.

Peter Wolf   28:08
Should we?
Maybe still put the UUID here?
Is there a need for us to go back and know where it came from?
Was there other information in that filtered articles?

Lem   28:15
Uh.
Yeah, because no. But the UUID there would be like multiple.
Let me just show you.
So basically we have we'll have on the all articles there are like different UUID here and then also for the filtered 1.

Peter Wolf   28:31
Yeah.

Lem   28:32
So we wouldn't be needing that one actually here on the.

Peter Wolf   28:32
Yeah.
This is the consolidated.

Lem   28:37
Yeah, this is already the content.

Peter Wolf   28:37
This is already the the equivalent of the total, right?

Bryan Wolf   28:40
Yeah.

Lem   28:41
Yeah, the total, yeah.

Peter Wolf   28:41
This is everything pulled together.

Lem   28:42
So yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   28:43
This is like a final draft.

Lem   28:44
Yeah, the. Yeah, the final draft.

Peter Wolf   28:44
OK.
This is the draft of the newsletter in a Google DOC form.

Lem   28:47
Yep, that's right.
Yep, OK.

Bryan Wolf   28:48
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   28:48
OK, got it.

Lem   28:51
And then, yeah, so for the web book I've set up Google app script.
So let me just show you, because this is actually not on.
So I've I, as I've said, we need to like create an extension for this particular spreadsheet and then.

Peter Wolf   29:04
Yep.

Lem   29:07
Go to the apps script.
Then let me just go here on the apps script.
So this one so the IT would be something like this. So we would need to like put the coding like Google's App scripts code for the like the web hook and then for this one this already we can just edit the like the hook here and also.
The columns.
And then, yeah.

Peter Wolf   29:31
So this is really identifying in the Google sheet and this is embedded in the Google sheet right in the Google sheet which tab and which field and which value is a trigger to make it call back and trigger the the make flow.

Lem   29:36
Yep, that's right. Yeah, for.
Yep, Yep.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   29:45
So guys, to me that is one like when I drop off this call, I think the rest of this day you guys should be the rest of the time we have here.

Bryan Wolf   29:50
Yes. Yeah, yeah. You wanna? Yes.

Peter Wolf   29:54
You guys should work through this process flow in detail, looking at exactly what he did and looking at the script because.
This is the kind of thing where I think you take this, you plug it into Cha Cha BD and get yourself acclimated to it and say, OK, if I wanted to use a different field in this spreadsheet and and work with.

Bryan Wolf   30:09
I know, but sometimes with Jason on on ChatGPT and Claude it like thinks it's doing a good job.

Lem   30:09
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   30:14
And it does do a good job, but then it'll misalign a code or where it just screws up the entire process.

Peter Wolf   30:17
OK, that happens. But you'll have to get used to.
You have to get used to iterating because I and I would use Claude.

Lem   30:24
Yep.

Peter Wolf   30:25
I would use Sonic 4 for the coding and you have to iterate.
It will mess up and then you say, hey, that didn't work and then you give it whatever error or whatever happened, you give it the most update you need to get used to that because that's going to be part of what you're doing.
You're going to have coding at different spots. You got to get used to writing that code just like the HTML.

Bryan Wolf   30:45
Mm hmm.

Peter Wolf   30:45
You got to get used to saying, hey, I want this.

Lem   30:45
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   30:47
This to look differently here.
Feed it in.
Tell me how I can make my lines tighter.
How I can make them bold or something and you need to practice iterating and looking at that and it doesn't look like you want you go back again and you say, hey, it's not what I want. Here's a picture.

Bryan Wolf   30:57
OK, OK.
OK. OK, OK. OK, OK.

Peter Wolf   31:00
What it looks like, but you got to do the same thing.

Lem   31:00
Yeah. Yep.

Peter Wolf   31:02
Here I think this is so critical because this function.
Ability to identify somewhere in the spreadsheet that you want to be a trigger to make to have make kick off.
That's critical, and we've used that a lot of times in different places.
That would be whether it's in a Microsoft environment or some other environment. There would be similar kind of thing, right?
A trigger that says OK inside a spreadsheet.
Maybe it's an Excel spreadsheet instead of the Google sheet, but you're gonna have a similar kind of thing and embedding of some logic that says make this field a trigger. When I change the status, automatically call that function.

Lem   31:37
Yep.

Peter Wolf   31:37
So I think it's really important you guys walk down through this and understand how they embed it into the Google sheet.
What the coding is you can run it through and say you know what happens if I change a field so you can see get used to identifying OK.
All this code is exact same except for identified the the column and the you know the cell.
The column and the row.
That's the one that it's gonna look at.

Lem   31:56
Yep.

Peter Wolf   31:57
Here's where the value is. If I change it from yes to no or blank to yes or something like that. You guys need to work through that stuff.

Bryan Wolf   32:01
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. OK.

Peter Wolf   32:04
OK. All right.

Lem   32:04
Yep, but actually Claude and ChatGPT are already intelligent enough for this.
Like for them, this is actually only simple.

Peter Wolf   32:10
Yeah, that's pretty basic.

Bryan Wolf   32:11
Right, yeah.

Lem   32:12
Yeah, this is only basic.

Peter Wolf   32:12
This is not complex code, yeah.

Lem   32:14
Yeah, so that's why I've also used like Claude for this one.
So it actually spit out correctly without the error.
You can actually check test it and debug.

Peter Wolf   32:23
So hey, you know what, Len? When you go through with them, if you'd kind of walk through the way you logically the way you did it, you will if this wasn't code that you were familiar with that you were writing, how did you go into or maybe you?

Bryan Wolf   32:24
Oh, nice.

Peter Wolf   32:35
Could even go to your dialogue with Chechi BT where you did your your prompting and kind of walk through it and say OK here.

Lem   32:42
Mm.

Peter Wolf   32:42
I need a code that's going to be a prompt trigger from within Google Sheets and this is how I did it and then kind of walk through the logic.
I mean, I know that for me that's helpful.

Lem   32:50
Yeah, yeah, I can do that.
Yeah, Yep. OK, no problem.

Peter Wolf   32:54
OK.
All right.
So good.
Now we have a full draft. We have a full draft and then we have a chance to edit in the Google Doc.

Lem   32:59
Yeah, we have.
A.
Yeah, that's right.
So we now we could add it here and then if it's already all good like like we've reviewed the content, then the conclusion and then the insights.
So now we could push it to ask a test e-mail and then this would also create.

Peter Wolf   33:18
Right. But hold on one second.
So this doesn't have the image in it though, so it's still not the finalized version. We will go into at the end. We simply go into brevo and we look at the final version and then we would complete it, right.

Lem   33:24
We.
Yeah, yeah.
So we have two two.
Yeah, basically that's it.
So we only have here the actually the image URL.

Peter Wolf   33:37
And it yeah, OK, that's fine.

Lem   33:37
So it's yeah.
And then if we push this one to the test e-mail, So what we will have is actually the formatting.
So now we would have the e-mail to us and then we could check that out. If the formatting is correct.
So and also of course of also the content if if is correct.

Peter Wolf   33:53
Yep.
Yep.

Lem   33:57
And then yeah, so if.

Peter Wolf   33:59
So let me ask you something here.
I think we're gonna want to update the prompt to tell it to do things like highlight keywords and use emojis or gooey's and stuff or images to to pump it up right. Because it's OK that this looks AI, it's not a problem.

Lem   34:12
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   34:16
It's not like we're trying to say this is our thought leadership.

Lem   34:16
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   34:19
And so when I look at superhuman e-mail, it's great because it has some stuff highlighted.
It's like, what's the most important words in this little blurb here?

Lem   34:27
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   34:27
It's calling out the key.
Just so I could scan this e-mail very quickly and decide whether that little fifty word blurb is worth reading or not.
Because I can look for the key points and say, Oh yeah, OK.
This is about AI and finance, or this is about a specific Fortune 500 company and they're applying AI.
That's where I think we should definitely tell it to to utilize Bolding, right?
And I don't know if it does that through Unicode or whatever, but if you're posting in LinkedIn, you gotta change it to Unicode.

Lem   34:49
OK.
Yep.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   34:55
But here it would say bold keywords.

Lem   34:56
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   34:58
You know, don't overdo it, but bold keywords use some emojis and.
Other graphics to include to spice up the bullets or draw attention to key points, right?

Lem   35:11
Yep.

Peter Wolf   35:11
So we would do that in the in the, in the, in the Persona part, right?

Lem   35:16
In the chat now in the, I think it would be on the ChatGPT because this is on the other one.

Peter Wolf   35:16
So we're calling the persona.

Lem   35:23
So let me just go.
So this is just the text.
It's just like consolidating all the subsection, so the next one actually is the formatin. So for the.

Peter Wolf   35:34
And writing of the of the true output blurb.

Lem   35:37
Yeah. So the.
This is actually yeah, this is the one. The automation that is actually formatting the particular content.
So we could edit this one, but yeah, we would need to have like different.

Peter Wolf   35:51
I think again, we probably need a a a document.
I don't know where you can go in this text content.

Lem   35:57
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   35:59
This is the full blurb or where where do you put your prompt?

Lem   36:02
This one.

Peter Wolf   36:02
Where's the detailed prompt? OK, so.

Lem   36:05
Yeah, I did the yeah. The the prompt is here on ChatGPT.

Peter Wolf   36:06
That.

Lem   36:09
So this one is just the text content and then yeah, we're we're feeding the text content and then chat G ChatGPT is the one who is coding the HTML code based on the final output here.

Peter Wolf   36:12
Yeah.

Lem   36:21
So it's just in inputting the basically we could add it here the body. So as you can see like the styling of the body and then.

Bryan Wolf   36:28
Yeah.

Lem   36:31
At the bottom here is the content.
So these are like dynamic contents.
Like today's insights. And then like here is the like the subsection content, the citation link that one and then.
The conclusion?
So yeah, for the we could also.
So we if we would need, if we want to like change the we would be, we would be changing it here on this particular prompt on the because this is the one that is formatting the like the style like the borders.

Peter Wolf   36:59
OK. Can we today when you're working with Bryan and Peter, can you do some tweak some and see show that we can do that and show where we do it in the code so we can figure out, OK, how do we add some emojis?

Bryan Wolf   37:00
Mm hmm.

Lem   37:11
Yep.

Peter Wolf   37:12
Add some images, add some highlighting like the the the title should be certainly bold. The and then keywords right critical keywords within the blurb of whatever that finalized blurb is that ChatGPT is writing. It should highlight the words that are the most.

Lem   37:20
Yep.

Peter Wolf   37:29
To draw, make it easy to scan, I would write the prompt like that right for the reader to easily scan and understand or quickly recognize the key concepts in that blurb by highlighting and bolding and emojis.

Lem   37:41
OK.
Here. Yeah, you mean here? Right on the on the the content.

Peter Wolf   37:43
Or whatever.
Yeah, right.
So you got the headers already.

Bryan Wolf   37:48
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   37:48
Bold but like here.

Lem   37:50
OK.

Peter Wolf   37:51
Like rising tide of AI generated resumes or you know.

Bryan Wolf   37:56
He just wants to mess around with the code.

Peter Wolf   37:57
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   37:59
Let's let's let's try and get through it and see the process for worse.
Get them uploaded onto make and signed in and everything.

Peter Wolf   38:03
Yeah. OK.

Lem   38:04
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   38:05
Let's do that first before we start tweaking everything internally, I understand.

Peter Wolf   38:06
OK.
But when you come back and tweak again, Aries and I think you guys should practice on is is changing and updating, enhancing how that content looks.

Bryan Wolf   38:09
Yeah, yes, yes, yes.
OK.

Peter Wolf   38:14
Because I know we're gonna want to manipulate that.
We're gonna want to manipulate the HTML.

Bryan Wolf   38:17
Yeah.

Lem   38:17
Yep.

Peter Wolf   38:18
It's not gonna look exactly the way I want.
We're gonna tighten it up, see? So I need you guys to practice and see how do I manipulate that?
Take the output HTML.
Plug it into ChatGPT and say hey, if I want the a bolder line around it or I wanna more squared instead of rounded edges or something like that.

Lem   38:30
Yep, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   38:33
OK. OK. OK.

Peter Wolf   38:34
That's the kind of thing you need to play around with a little bit.

Lem   38:37
Yeah, yeah. So let me. Yeah. So this is actually the this is triggering here on the this one as I've said, so final finalized push push a test e-mail.

Peter Wolf   38:38
OK.
Yep.

Lem   38:49
So when we click yes, this will trigger automatically and then yeah it will search for the content and then feed it to ChatGPT.
ChatGPT will format it and create the e-mail campaign to.
And then it will send a test e-mail to us and then yeah, it will update our database to send and.
I have the campaign ID so we would have this one for example this one here and then it will have the sent. So this one is not yet there.
So after that one we could check now our e-mail and check the final output.
So if the final output is OK now, we could click here.
Yes. So after we click here, yes, this, this the last automation will trigger.
So the number four this will trigger.
And.
Yeah, this one.
So this will trigger and it will search the database for that particular particular content and then it will just send the newsletter campaign.
So we won't be needing to get going to check on brevo. So all is already here on the on yeah, on the spreadsheet, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   40:00
Correct.

Lem   40:01
And then yeah, we would have the date newsletter sent, but of course you can also check the brevo like we have here, like the.

Peter Wolf   40:08
Yeah.

Lem   40:09
The If the open open rates, the if they click the particular link so we we actually have that stats here on brevo, yeah on the brevo.

Peter Wolf   40:19
Anyway, to feed stats back?
Is there an API to bring the stats back?

Lem   40:22
Yeah, I think so.
We could, yeah.
Yeah, they they have an API endpoint for the stats.
So we could actually add that to like another, for example here.

Peter Wolf   40:31
I would.
Why wouldn't you just add it to the row there?
Just other columns and put the stats so you already sent it and then you it's got the ID and now you get the stats as they come back in. It would update that spreadsheet.

Lem   40:36
Yep.
Yeah, but I think because after we sent it, we won't know if they already like click it on that time.
So we won't be putting it here because if we put it here on the after it sent, what will happen is the stats will be just zero, if that makes sense.

Peter Wolf   41:02
Yeah, OK. But what about we make another flow that says manually going to make and trigger to say update stats?

Lem   41:07
Yeah, yeah, we can do that, yeah.
So yeah, that's right.
So we would have another like column.

Peter Wolf   41:11
And it can update the stats of all the flows because the stats could update.
You know, someone could click on one and let's say we were doing it daily, which we're not going to do it.
Someone could click on one of those five days later, right?
They didn't read any of them.

Lem   41:24
Yeah. Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   41:24
Now all of a sudden they're going through a bunch of them at once, so you can just say update all stats for the past, you know, week or.
The the campaign's number one through 5 or something like that.

Lem   41:29
Yep.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, we could actually.
Check here on the logs, but yeah, I think we could push this data on the make.

Peter Wolf   41:43
OK.
Alright, we don't need that right now, 'cause. We know we can look on here, but I think that would be attractive ultimately to have all the information of the newsletters and all the stats in the spreadsheet.

Lem   41:47
Yeah.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   41:54
Awesome. So let me tell you, Lim, you're you're doing a great job.

Lem   41:55
Yep.
Mm hmm.

Peter Wolf   41:59
I mean, I was overnight was looking at and thinking about what I wanted as design and we talked about it a bit yesterday, but I still was formulating kind of the ways I wanted.

Lem   42:00
OK.
Thanks. Thanks.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   42:09
What you came up with here is exactly what I want. So.

Lem   42:12
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   42:13
Yeah.
That's awesome.
I would take the the bottom one.
That research.
I'd make that flow 0, right?

Lem   42:19
Yep.

Peter Wolf   42:20
Because you could manually input at any time and just say yeah, this is a trigger input.

Lem   42:22
Yeah, this one. Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   42:25
It's not happening later on.
It's like so I think this is terrific.

Lem   42:29
Yeah. Oops.

Peter Wolf   42:32
What I want, what I'm gonna need to do, let me show you again.
The the superhuman because this is really what I'm taking as the foundation and what what I'm seeing here, Lem is really terrific.
Amazing stuff.
I'm really excited about this.
So if I go to.
Uh. Personal accounts? Uh.
Superhuman. OK.
So let me share.
Right, so this is it. Download pictures.
So what we're gonna do is we're gonna come up with a header, and that header would always be added to the intro, right?

Lem   43:23
OK.

Peter Wolf   43:25
And we'll do something like this with a date so we can have some fixed structure that will include.

Lem   43:26
Yep.

Peter Wolf   43:32
Then these are the individual blurb sections right now.
What they also have here is this kind of stuff.
You know what?
I'm gonna come up with this other inputs that would have.
Section.
And we'll have to figure out how we pull them all together.
So when you have the the campaign, can you update part of the campaign and then feed the rest in or does it have to all be fed at once?
Like what if?

Lem   44:01
The.

Peter Wolf   44:02
What if you had?
You had your intro and your, you know, five articles and forget the the conclusion right now and let's say I wanted to come up with these other sections like this.
It's like the prompt of the week and you know, and and tools you might be interested in. It's it's not an article, but it's gonna have a section like this and we structure a section and we have these kind of three additional sections that would say things happen.

Lem   44:15
OK.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   44:29
At serrala tools, you might be interested in and prompt of the week. Let's just say we had that, so I would need a way to put them and include them in that spreadsheet.

Lem   44:34
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   44:40
In the second tab, saying I definitively want these in.
But they're going to have a different structure, right?
They're not going to go the same way.

Lem   44:49
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   44:50
So that's the problem is.

Lem   44:51
Yep.

Peter Wolf   44:53
I feel like it's it's at the point when you have the draft, it's really at the point you have the draft. It's like we want to pop, we want to add them in then and say, well, that was the draft that was just the newsletters I need to.
Add the other sections and then we we we take that draft and yeah, somehow I need to get those other sections in, right because they're not going to have the same process.
It might not have a blurb right again.

Lem   45:19
Uh.

Peter Wolf   45:19
It might just be the prompt of the week and we just put it like this with a header and.

Lem   45:25
We we could, if we would do this, it would be on the.

Peter Wolf   45:25
Yeah, this. Yeah.

Lem   45:31
Before the creation of the text, so we would have another step there that would have this one or like you want it to be like depending on the newsletter like it's there or it's not.

Peter Wolf   45:45
No, what?

Lem   45:46
Or.

Peter Wolf   45:46
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hold on.
Let me say that again.
Make sure I understood depend on the newsletter. How?

Lem   45:51
Yeah. So basically you have like other sections here, right?

Peter Wolf   45:55
Yep.

Lem   45:55
So we could actually add that on the like the second automation, let me just check on the yeah, on the number 2. So new search field.
Oh, no on I think.
Let me just.

Peter Wolf   46:11
Maybe they go into the number 2, but they have a unique identifier that says they don't go through the the. The cause at that point you you're still waiting to get the blurb from the the the finalized blurb, right?

Lem   46:12
Yeah. Yeah, on #2.
Yeah, on #2.

Peter Wolf   46:26
Not the summary, but the slant, but the finalized blurb.
So they're all gonna go through the through that process of getting the finalized blurb, right?

Lem   46:36
Yeah. So it would be there on actually on number 2 and then we would add a section there and then we would just add the prompt, prompting additional prompting on the ChatGPT. The next one, the #3.
But yeah, let's say for this one like prompt stations, we would have another route which is the prompt station and then it would create the like this particular section for it and then it we would put that to the text document.
So does that make sense?

Peter Wolf   47:05
Can you go back to the flow and let's look at the flow 2nd?

Lem   47:08
Yeah. Yeah. Let me just share my screen again.

Peter Wolf   47:10
And.

Lem   47:13
So basically we could add as much as we want here.
So can you see my screen?
So this is actually the one creating the the content.

Peter Wolf   47:21
Yep.

Lem   47:24
So what we would do is we would just add here another route and then we could not.

Peter Wolf   47:29
Make it another variable.

Lem   47:31
Yeah. And then we, we for example, we could pull it out to like a different spreadsheet.
Let's say we have a spreadsheet here for, let's say, prompts or some or. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, something like that.

Peter Wolf   47:42
For manual inputs or non article inputs or something.

Lem   47:46
And then this would this would pull out from that spreadsheet or and then it would, yeah, create that particular section.
Then we would just add it here on the.
On the create the Google Doc.

Peter Wolf   47:57
Perfect. So it'll be another variable you'd grab when you're putting the Google doc together. I love that.

Lem   47:58
Yeah. Yeah, that's right, yeah.
Yep. Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   48:02
So another tab and maybe it's.

Lem   48:04
So we could, yeah.

Peter Wolf   48:05
Yeah, we'll have to figure out how many of these sections we want, but essentially it's another tab that we can feed in.

Lem   48:09
We could add it here. Yep.

Peter Wolf   48:11
Will already go through a process of structuring through ChatGPT, making the wording if there's necessary. If there's an image that that would all go through.

Lem   48:18
Yep.

Peter Wolf   48:20
A different line, but then be another variable that's grabbed in and put into the Google Doc.

Lem   48:25
Yeah, that's right.
So basically so that it would be clear this particular automation is the one that's creating just the content, the text content and then so if you would need if you would add like another section. So we would add it here, right. And but it would be like a.

Peter Wolf   48:33
Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   48:34
Right.

Peter Wolf   48:40
Yeah.

Lem   48:41
Text only and then we would also need to edit the here the other one, the number three. So this would actually.
Format that particular section also. So we would need to edit the prompt here so.

Peter Wolf   48:54
To say that it's coming in. Yeah, because that that that's not going to be format same, right?

Lem   48:56
Yeah, so it's.

Peter Wolf   49:00
It's not HTML where it's going to have the wording a header, and it's going to an image. It's going to be something different.

Lem   49:00
Yep, that's right. Because. Yeah. Yeah, because.

Peter Wolf   49:06
So there'd be another path and a variable here then, right?

Lem   49:06
Yeah, that's right, Sir.
Yeah, another variable here which is let's say the like the hot topics, like something like that. Then yeah, we would add it here on the another table here or or depending on our format, which is like the dynamic hot topics like that.
So yeah, basically that's how we would update that one, Yep.

Peter Wolf   49:22
Perfect. Love it. Love it.
This is gonna be great.

Lem   49:27
So yeah, we could actually.

Peter Wolf   49:28
I mean, can you go back just to that, the draft one you got?
I mean, just look at this.
It's just this is after only a couple days, right?
You start on this on Sunday or Monday.
This is just just with that kind of 2-3 iterations that we've had. To me, this is already amazing, right again.

Lem   49:42
This one.

Bryan Wolf   49:43
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   49:49
We I just think this is awesome.
Here we do some folding add some.
Of visual stuff and then a couple other sections that are gonna be. This is the hot. This is the latest topics and articles.
Here's the hottest things going on in SAP Treasury.

Lem   50:00
Yep.

Peter Wolf   50:02
Here's some tools we think you might be interested in, and here's a prompt of the week. I think that would be really good ****.

Lem   50:08
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, it would be.
Yeah, we could just add more, more sections here on the yeah, here on the second, number two, on the number 2 automation, yeah.

Peter Wolf   50:13
Yep.
Perfect. I love it. Lam it's awesome.

Lem   50:21
You could just add it. Thanks. Yep.

Peter Wolf   50:23
Really this to me.
This flow right here is just a maximum high value, unbelievable flow just for my company.
This would go across every team, every team could be putting out a newsletter to all their customers. The company as a whole could put out a newsletter.

Bryan Wolf   50:35
So listen. Listen, do you want?

Peter Wolf   50:39
I think this is amazing stuff.

Bryan Wolf   50:41
So do you want us to to implement this today or with like the you know the amount of changes that you said again today let Lem work on it and?

Peter Wolf   50:47
No, but the changes are going to be another another. I mean. So I think it's worth moving forward with creating this right now and you guys playing around with it, getting used to it.
These iterations I think are as much as they may feel like. They're frustrating to me, their learning experience and their part of the part of the process, yeah.

Lem   51:01
Yep.
But yeah, actually actually if you already.
Understand this like cool process here. So that for me on my part. Personally the most important thing here is getting like the logic of the whole system. And then if you like already got the whole logic you could actually like manipulate this to add a section. Yeah, that.

Peter Wolf   51:19
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   51:24
And justice, add another row.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.

Lem   51:26
Why? That's right. So the most important thing first is like like understanding.

Bryan Wolf   51:30
Get in the base, yeah.

Lem   51:31
All, yeah.
For example, this one is just creating the text content and then the other one is creating the formatting.
So yeah, that like some new assets like that is important to manipulate, Yep.

Peter Wolf   51:41
I see you guys.
You need to get to the point where you can walk through this flow and explain it to other people, like to make a little training video and ultimately for your GitHub explaining that and taking this and saying hey, here's taking the content using the Jason file and im.
And putting the images in, not just the Jason file because again looking at what we did with turning that into a process flow, I think you take the image and you put that into ChatGPT.
Along with the Jason file you say write me a dialogue that tells me how to explain this and you guys need to be thinking about and practicing that because ultimately when you're interviewing with companies, you're gonna want to be able to pull this up and say, yeah, I.
Create this flow.
Work with my team.
Boom, we do this.
Go over here.
This is the logic.
This is why we did this.
This is why we're calling over here.
We want an extra input, so we had another flow. You have to become really comfortable with this stuff. So as you're working through and then playing with it and having Lem kinda guide you.

Bryan Wolf   52:33
Mm hmm.

Lem   52:38
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   52:40
You should be thinking in those terms.
Am I understanding the concepts?
Am I understanding why the steps are built the way they are? Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   52:45
Right, right. Right. Right, right. OK, great.

Lem   52:48
Yep.

Peter Wolf   52:50
So I say yes, absolutely. I want to move forward this and and I want to be planning those other steps because I want to get this thing to actual production.

Bryan Wolf   52:50
Alright, let's move forward. Let's go.

Lem   52:51
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   52:51
Let's yeah.
OK.
All right, let's go.

Lem   53:00
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   53:00
Let's let's all go.

Peter Wolf   53:01
Yeah. OK.
So I'm gonna drop off and and you guys can again, I would just named a couple things I think are valuable to for you to work through.

Lem   53:02
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   53:04
Yeah.
Yes.

Peter Wolf   53:11
Should I leave my recording on or should I just send the notes from my recording?

Bryan Wolf   53:15
Hold on, I think.

Peter Wolf   53:15
You guys have the internal one from copilot.

Bryan Wolf   53:17
So we have the internal one going.

Peter Wolf   53:20
OK.

Bryan Wolf   53:20
I I think I have an internal one going.

Peter Wolf   53:22
It's automatic, right?

Bryan Wolf   53:22
Yeah. Yeah, why not? Yes. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   53:23
These meetings I have them set up to automatically create.

Bryan Wolf   53:26
Then you're good.

Peter Wolf   53:27
So I'm gonna send the notes from what I'm cutting out of mine. Just OK.

Bryan Wolf   53:30
No, I've got it's recording, yeah.
Yeah. All right.

Peter Wolf   53:34
All right.
Yeah, that's that's great stuff.
Lemm I'm gonna try and come up with the other content, but I got a lot of stuff to do today, so I don't know if it's gonna happen today, but I think you know the the next couple days of training with these guys is going through the FL.

Lem   53:38
Oh, Gabe it. Thanks.

Bryan Wolf   53:42
OK.

Lem   53:44
OK.

Peter Wolf   53:48
We already have making sure the logic looking at the nuances.

Bryan Wolf   53:49
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   53:51
Of the different routes and how we're prompting and where to prompt information is, and certainly the coding and the integration to the spreadsheets, I think all those hooks, they're critical things that they need to be drilling into.
So walking through those and the troubleshooting too, right cuz Brian, you said my thing is still not working right.

Bryan Wolf   54:03
OK.

Lem   54:04
Yep.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   54:10
Yeah, you know what I think that is.

Peter Wolf   54:10
We need to get through that.

Bryan Wolf   54:11
I know what it is, I can fix it so I'm not even worried about it, OK?

Peter Wolf   54:13
OK.
Well, let's make sure by the end of this call you got another hour that that's resolved.

Bryan Wolf   54:15
All right, OK. OK. OK.

Peter Wolf   54:17
So I can have that working OK.

Bryan Wolf   54:19
Yep.

Peter Wolf   54:19
All right guys. Thanks.

Bryan Wolf   54:21
All right, Sir.

Peter Wolf   54:21
Talk to you. Bye.

Lem   54:23
OK, Peter, uh, talk to you soon.

Bryan Wolf   54:26
All right, Lynn.

Lem   54:28
Have you guys already downloaded the Jason?

Bryan Wolf   54:32
So listen, I I have this for I have.
I have the first one down.
It's hard to download all of them 'cause you gotta kind of work through them 'cause it won't let you save it.
Let's go here.
Can I just? I wanna before we even start. I.

Lem   54:41
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   54:45
Cannot get like. Where do I set this up on here?
I know you keep telling me I have to create an app first, right?

Lem   54:51
Oh, the and splash. Yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   54:53
Right, so do I need the premium version?

Lem   54:54
Yep, so.
No, no need.
So you just go here.

Bryan Wolf   54:58
OK.

Lem   55:00
Let me just get my.

Bryan Wolf   55:01
Yeah. Why don't you show me why that you don't?

Lem   55:04
I think it's on different website. Here on I'll put it on a chat.
Let me just check if this is the right one.
Can you try to open this one?

Bryan Wolf   55:24
Yeah.

Lem   55:25
Because it's actually a different.
Yeah. And then go to.

Bryan Wolf   55:41
Oh, this is what I made demo new.

Lem   55:44
OK.
Yeah, no, I just opened that one.
So I think we have at the bottom.

Bryan Wolf   55:51
So is this it?

Lem   55:53
Yeah, but we need to edit the the. Can you go down 1st?

Bryan Wolf   55:55
I.
Tried.

Lem   55:58
Yeah, this one.
The redirect URL.
So the redirect URL is actually this one.
Let me just copy it and.

Bryan Wolf   56:04
Yeah.

Lem   56:06
Paste it to you in this one.
So yeah, this this is the redirect URL.
So just copy this one then paste it there.
And then click all of the.
The check.
Yeah, the check Marks and also can you go up a little bit?
The Yeah this already. OK. And then just see if it first get have you saved it already?

Bryan Wolf   56:35
I see it, I see.

Lem   56:37
OK.
It's already good.
Yeah, I think this should.
This should work.

Bryan Wolf   56:40
OK.

Lem   56:41
So for the yeah, this is the client key and then client ID and the secret key. So the client ID is the one above and then secret key is there.
Yep. Then yes, Brian. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   56:58
OK, great.
Great. OK.

Lem   57:01
Yeah. So yeah, you can actually change the like the query. As you can see.

Bryan Wolf   57:02
Do I need to?

Lem   57:05
So you can change that to.
I've just added there a generic like business, so it's actually like searching business photos, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   57:09
That's fine.
Yeah. OK.

Lem   57:14
Yep. And then yeah.
So for this other ones, it's just yeah, Google Docs spreadsheets, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   57:19
So this is I got this done now.
How can I put this on you?

Lem   57:30
Yeah, you OK?

Bryan Wolf   57:31
I got it.

Lem   57:32
Yeah, I think there's a route there.
Can you you?

Bryan Wolf   57:35
No, I I switched it 'cause. I was trying to save it. It's all good.

Lem   57:39
Oh, OK.
Yep, Yep.
Can you try to click this like one?
This at the save button there's like a one there. Yeah, at the right side, the 6th one, the 6th.
Yeah, that one autoline.

Bryan Wolf   57:57
This one.

Lem   57:58
No, the. Yeah, that one. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   57:59
The wand.

Lem   58:02
Yeah, it's OK. Yeah, I thought.
There's like a router there or something.

Bryan Wolf   58:05
So here's is not fine you to TJ song.

Lem   58:10
Yeah, these are already has the.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   58:20
Should I try and re up import it?

Lem   58:20
The IT did.
You already added the like the accounts.
Oh, I think it's the Jason structure.
Yeah, I think this is the can you click the all data into one bundle?

Bryan Wolf   58:27
Yeah.
Where where is that?

Lem   58:32
I think that's the the one in the middle. The color Violet, one the node that has a name, the module that has.
Yeah, that one, yeah.
So yeah, this is the also.
And then let me just check.
My so yeah, this is also the problem on like importing Jason because as you can see this is actually the data structure here is saved on.

Bryan Wolf   58:51
Yeah.

Lem   59:03
On.
Make on my account so you can just add there like title, summary and UUID so title.

Bryan Wolf   59:06
Yeah.
For the day now, Kamala.

Lem   59:11
Yeah, the name, title and then.

Bryan Wolf   59:15
Should I type that in there or pull it title?

Lem   59:17
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   59:18
B.

Lem   59:19
It should be like this.
Let me just copy it, I think.
Yeah, you can in the chat.
Yeah, this one so title. So title and then map the title which is coming from the coming from the Ino reader and then the summary that.

Bryan Wolf   59:38
Like this?

Lem   59:40
Is, oh, I think it worked.

Bryan Wolf   59:41
I think I just copied it, yeah.

Lem   59:42
Yeah, I think it worked, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   59:46
OK, see.

Lem   59:46
It's 36, right?

Bryan Wolf   59:46
Yeah. Yeah, it did.

Lem   59:46
Yeah, yeah, I think it worked, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   59:48
It did.

Lem   59:49
OK.
That's good, yeah.
OK. And then yeah, I'm yeah.

Bryan Wolf   59:53
OK.
So this works.
So let's let's push back here.
Now let's I think I have to import the. OK, so hold on.

Lem   59:56
So.
Yeah, you can actually put it on a folder so that.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:05
It all stays together.

Lem   1:00:06
Yeah, it's much for the documentation. Would be much easier to track.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:07
Yeah, I have to do that.
All or gpt.

Lem   1:00:16
For this one, yeah, you would need to have another hook, so just click add.
Web hook.
Yeah. So click add and then yeah, just name it to #2.
#2 so yeah, #2 web hook and then yeah, so.
And then click save.
So what we are actually doing here is we are assigning a web book as you can see there's like a link there, right?
So this is the one that this is the one that we will be adding on the yeah Google Apps script.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:49
Put into yeah. OK.

Lem   1:00:51
Yeah. So I just click save then.
Yeah. So for the other ones, yeah, that other accounts.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:57
Hello.

Lem   1:01:00
For this one you would need to let me just give you an access to the spreadsheet and then you could just like copy paste the.
So I think I haven't.
Let me just copy it here.
And this one so that you can like copy the my formatting, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:18
What it where? Where do I put it?

Lem   1:01:22
Yeah, because the I think.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:23
Do I plug it in here like this?
The link you just gave me or do I plug that in here for the spreadsheet ID or?

Lem   1:01:29
No, I it it.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:31
Oh, that's the spreadsheet.

Lem   1:01:31
It's much better, yeah.
Yeah, the spreadsheet.
Yeah, the the the spreadsheet on.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:34
OK.

Lem   1:01:36
Yeah, that one.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:36
Alright, so let me let me do. Oh, ****. Hold on.

Lem   1:01:39
Just copy paste it and.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:43
This one right. This is it, right?

Lem   1:01:47
Yeah, yeah, this one.
This one's mine.
Yep. So just create a new one.
Yeah, create a.
Yeah, make a copy, OK.
And then just.
Because maybe it would get confusing later. Yeah, that that.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:07
I gotta keep the name the same.
I gotta keep the new, OK?

Lem   1:02:09
Yeah, because the name is the same, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:10
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:02:13
So.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:13
But so do I keep copy or do I just do newsletter?

Lem   1:02:18
I think this is.
Yeah, you can add like a.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:24
But so I'm saying like it minds a copy.

Lem   1:02:25
Shan.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:26
Is it a copy or do I keep this newsletter process flow database?

Lem   1:02:27
Yeah, I think I'm it's much better for mine to be the copy.
So yeah, you just add yours as.
I can.
You can add that make a copy first, then we'll just change.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:38
So make it like this.

Lem   1:02:40
Yeah, yeah. Just make a make a copy.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:44
But that's not going to be wrong in the routing for cause of the name's different, right?
Oh. Oh ****. I just made three of them.

Lem   1:02:51
Yeah, it would.
So as you can see, there's like the other one that has.
Like, yeah, this one is mine.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:57
The share. That's yours, yeah.

Lem   1:02:58
Yeah, you can just change.
I can just change mine actually. Just I'll.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:02
Oh, it's cool, but it's the same. It's the same.
Yeah. So let me let me delete this one.

Lem   1:03:06
Yeah, it's the same. So.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:07
OK.
Great. OK.

Lem   1:03:08
Yeah, I know it's we need to rename yours because maybe you can.
You get confused.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:15
No, no, no, I think.

Lem   1:03:16
Later.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:17
I think I think what all I needed.
I'm just gonna remove this one because I have.
I have mine.
It's the same name.
I just it's not the shared one. That way it'll will it still go to my Google Sheets and it's the same name and I can map it to mine.

Lem   1:03:31
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:31
Right. Yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:03:32
Yeah, you can map it.
Yeah. OK.
That's good.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:37
Save.

Lem   1:03:39
Then.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:42
Yeah, 'cause. OK, let's.
So here's the thing though, is that I I was trying to just move my for my dad's thing.
I don't know if it's.
Yeah, it'll find it. Yeah. OK.
OK.
I'm just gonna go.
Thank you.

Lem   1:04:26
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:00
Turn up.
So now how do I create a folder right here OK.

Lem   1:05:03
Location date.
Yeah, the the plus button.
Yeah, that one.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:15
Now how do I pull **** into it? I just.
I just drag over.

Lem   1:05:22
Just you can go to the particular scenarios and then the drop down on the right side.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:24
Awesome.

Lem   1:05:30
Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:31
Sure.

Lem   1:05:33
Yeah, there's and then yeah, move the folder so they don't have the like drag and drop, I think.
Still don't have the drag and drop, so you would need to move it 1 by 1.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:45
OK.

Lem   1:05:46
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:47
Great.

Lem   1:05:48
Can.
You could, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:53
I'll just do it at first.
Should I add another one to this one too?

Lem   1:06:00
Yeah, I add another one.
So that would be the number three web hook or.
So for this one.
You we already assigned a web book, right?
So this web book actually can't be used on other automation.
So this is just.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:25
OK.

Lem   1:06:26
Yeah, this is just for this particular automation. Yep, that's right. So.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:28
For this one, OK.
All right.

Lem   1:06:33
That's and then, Yep. Also Debra.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:38
So I didn't make a bread. I don't think I have a brevo API or I think I might hold on.
I don't know if it works though.
Hold on, 'cause. It was free. I thought, right?
Or no API over there. I don't think this.
Let me see.

Lem   1:06:59
Yeah, it's free.
You just need to register for their account.
The free plan.
But yeah, we could access the API key.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:04
I think I sent it out.
So I think this is right.
Alright, let's just do it like this.
Yeah. OK.

Lem   1:07:29
Yeah, that's good.
Then us.
Bravo for the e-mail.
So can you see the e-mail there?

Bryan Wolf   1:07:38
Yeah. Hold on. Let me go back.

Lem   1:07:39
Yeah, it should be your e-mail.
So all of this one.
So this is actually mine too.
Just change it to your e-mail, then up to the bottom one.
So this is the like the two.
And then there's also like the from the bottom.
So.
And then there's, yeah, that one.
There's another one there.
Then yeah, just uh click save. OK, that's good.
Then you flow.
Yeah, it's really good.
Yep. So this ad, this is for 4th 1:00 and then Yep, this already OK.
Oh, right.
It's the API key.
Here we need the the API key for the so.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:54
For in this.

Lem   1:08:56
Here on the did you? Nope. On the color blue one.
Then you send newsletter campaign.
So this is actually the. Yeah. This one, as you can see the below the API key.
This X key sib.
So this is the API key for my account.
So you could change this one to yours.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:11
Mm hmm.
Now for which for API key for which website?
What is this for?

Lem   1:09:17
For brevo, this is for brevo.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:19
OK.
So I just put my bravo key in there.

Lem   1:09:21
Yeah. Brad will key here.
API key for your breville.
Yep, this one. Then click save.
Then yeah, it's already good.
And Yep, now you got. Oh, Oh yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:46
Oh.
Good.

Lem   1:09:48
So now you can. Do you have the pro plan?
Yeah, I think you have pro plan here, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:09:53
I do.
I do, yeah.

Lem   1:09:54
Yeah. So you could actually turn.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:55
So I can just turn them on.

Lem   1:09:56
Yeah, turn this on.
But we need to manually trigger.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:00
Start the first one.

Lem   1:10:01
Yeah, the first one, but the other ones we don't need to.
Oh, right. We we need we first need.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:05
I see. OK.

Lem   1:10:09
To oh, we first need to.
Yeah, the INA reader, I think.
The folder is also assigned to my folder so.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:20
Yeah. I don't even have AI.

Lem   1:10:21
Yeah, just.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:21
Don't even.
This is not Even so which which do I have to pick one folder?

Lem   1:10:26
Yeah, just one folder.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:28
OK.

Lem   1:10:28
Can you go back to your RSS in reader and?
Yeah, I think you could choose one there.
This is, I think the same.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:37
Yeah.

Lem   1:10:38
Yeah. So for testing purposes, you can just change it anyway in the like for the RSS feed.
Yeah, we can actually go to your articles and then check the.
Yeah, an finance in Pakistan.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:55
Yeah, but it says Google News too. That's OK, though.

Lem   1:10:57
Tesla's all right.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:00
It's whatever.
I'll. I'll do that one, OK.

Lem   1:11:01
Yeah.
And then Yep.
Then save.
Oh, we yeah, we need to have the Google script.
So I'll just let me just copy my the code.
I think I can send it here also, right?
Let's check this one.
Yeah, I think we could.
I could also send this one so.
Open your spreadsheet.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:32
OK.

Lem   1:11:33
The newsletter flow. Yeah, this one.
Then go to.
Uh, go to extensions so at the top. Uh, beside the tools.
So there's ah, no. This is actually my.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:47
Oh, this is the shared one.

Lem   1:11:48
Yeah, this is the shared one, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:48
This is the shared one, right?

Lem   1:11:52
Need to go to the.
Yep, this one.
So extensions, then apps script.
And then.
Right.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:03
It's right here, right or?

Lem   1:12:06
You copy pasted it right?

Bryan Wolf   1:12:09
No. Which no I which webhook with the which one do I need to copy?

Lem   1:12:11
Yeah.
Oh, it's already.
Yeah, the apps script is also copied already, so that's good.
And then you would just need.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:20
So this is good.

Lem   1:12:23
You would just need to change the hooks there so as you can see at the yeah this .3 so for the.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:27
These three.

Lem   1:12:34
Yeah. Can you go back to?
Yeah. So this is number new search out here.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:41
2.

Lem   1:12:43
Yeah, #2.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:43
Rochelle.

Lem   1:12:44
So this is actually on the.
H.
This one so web.
Let me just check.
Yeah, I think it's.
Let me just check.
'Cause we.
Yeah, it's the on the H.
Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:04
OK, great.

Lem   1:13:04
And then this one is the number three is on the.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:05
Here's 3.

Lem   1:13:11
C.
Yeah. This on the C here, that one.
And then the other one is on E, the number 4.
So that's the last trigger for the automation.
I see on.
Yep, OK.
And then.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:31
Deploy.

Lem   1:13:32
Click save here on the beside the run. So I see on the left side, yeah, that there's a, yeah, save project drive and then go to the left side.
Nope. Just go back there and then you can see a clock.
There's a clock, right?
Yeah, that one.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:47
For triggers.

Lem   1:13:48
Yeah. The trigger yeah triggers.
And then.
Yeah. So add the trigger.
And then yeah, on edit trigger and then just on the select event type click on edit.
Yeah, just the onedit trigger.
Yeah, that one. Then on the below the select event type, no?

Bryan Wolf   1:14:15
Wait, wait. So hold on.
What am I changing this?

Lem   1:14:18
Yeah. No, this actually on edit trigger. This is actually connected to that particular function or code.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:25
OK.

Lem   1:14:27
And then change the after that one the select event. After that one the select event type.
Nope. From spreadsheet.
And then yeah, that one to unedit, OK.
So basically, whenever we edit that column based on the coding, so it would trigger and then that just which which function to run so.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:42
Huh.
OK.

Lem   1:14:48
As you can see this on edit trigger I will explain it later. So just save it for now.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:51
OK, OK.

Lem   1:14:56
And then it will have.
A.
Authentication there, yeah.
So there's an authentication and then click advanced.
Yeah, advanced and then go to my go to my project. Yeah, this one.
So we need to authorize it.
Yeah, this one then just click allow.
Yep, so it's already good.
So can you go back to the code there on the Google Apps trip and then to the code editor?
Yeah. So it's actually calling this particular function as you can see, there's a function on edit trigger, so it's yeah, it's calling this one, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:37
Yeah.

Lem   1:15:41
And then, Yep, so this should be already good.
And now we could test it live.
So.
Can go to your folder.
Could actually go to your folder, so it's much easier.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:54
Yeah.

Lem   1:15:56
This one much easier to.
Then yeah, turn it on.
Yep, so.
OK.
Oh, permission denied.
Yeah, I think you need.
You would need to remap this particular spreadsheet to your own.
That's why I've said, yeah, it's sometimes it gets confusing if.
We have the same name.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:28
Did you copy?
So here this is.

Lem   1:16:29
Yeah, the same.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:30
This is what I last night I was. Yeah, OK. OK.

Lem   1:16:32
You could just change the name, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:35
Just change the name of my thing.

Lem   1:16:36
Just. Yeah, just change so that we would have.
Because sometimes the make the little like confused sometimes. So just change the. Oh yeah, just change the name to like.
Naming convention.
Yeah, we could just.
OK. And then Yep.
Then just click uh refresh.
Yeah. So this would already be on the.
Us that one.
Then yeah, for the. Yeah, for the rest.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:17
I gotta do that for the for the rest of them. All right.

Lem   1:17:20
Yeah. For the rest also also the the first one, the search for duplicates 1.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:25
Where? Hold on. Wait this one.

Lem   1:17:27
Yeah. Yeah, that one. Yep.
The USDA, that one.
It's actually also picking up my shared link, so that's why it's it's confusing.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:50
Yeah, I see. I know.

Lem   1:17:53
Yeah, it's picking up the.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:54
OK.

Lem   1:17:59
And then Yep, I think this would be.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:01
I hope we gotta do it to the other ones, right? Yeah.

Lem   1:18:01
But for other. Yeah, yeah. For the other scenarios it would also error out if.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:51
Out of the sheets draft.
Does this matter?

Lem   1:18:55
No, it's OK.
I think we have.
Yeah, it's the same.
It's we have the same sheets because you. Yeah, the.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:01
Right. Oh, internally, it's like this thing.

Lem   1:19:04
Yeah, it's. Can you check?

Bryan Wolf   1:19:06
It's like one of these, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.

Lem   1:19:08
Yeah, yeah, it's a it's it's, it's still the same.
Yeah, we we would just need to remap the particular spreadsheet because I think it's on the shared 1 shared link.
So in the shared link one.
And then all right, we we would need to go back to the #3.
And then there's some nuances here on the brevo on the create the e-mail campaign. So.
Yeah, there and then.
Can you go down to the just go down?
Yeah. So this is also.
On my e-mail.
And then yeah, we, we would need to add a list here. So as you can see the bottom, there's no.

Bryan Wolf   1:20:38
OK.
Tell me where.

Lem   1:20:47
On the yeah, this one.
So the recipient your list. So we need to set this up on brevo.
No, below below that one. So as you can see there's like recipients.
And then exclusion list and then your list. As you can see.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:03
Wait, hold on. Are you saying?
Are you saying in reply to or to field?

Lem   1:21:06
No, no, no.
Below that one on the recipients. Yeah. Yeah. The other one. The. Yeah, that one.
Unchecked, yeah.
So this is your first lease. So we we would need to set up your brevo so that we could test it up, test it up, test it. So on the brevo just yeah, just go on your brevo account.
Revolution first.
And then.
Yeah, I think we need to.
Bye.
And then go to your.
Contacts.
On the left side, yeah, the contacts and then just go on the list.
Then your first list.
Yeah, I think.
Do you have contacts there?
Yeah, you already have the your first list, so just click that one.
Oh, yeah, yeah, we already have your e-mail, so it's OK.
Yeah, this would work for testing.
So just go to your back to your make. Yeah. And then you already click the your first list, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:22:17
Nice.

Lem   1:22:25
OK. So and then just click save.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:25
Mm hmm.

Lem   1:22:29
So basically that would send the e-mail campaign to that list.
So if you have like 10 emails there for other person so it would send to this particular list. So for now you have just your own e-mail here yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:40
OK.
Yeah.

Lem   1:22:43
OK.
And yeah, I think, yeah, I think this is good.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:47
Try it.

Lem   1:22:48
Yeah, we could try it.
Hmm.
Oh right. The Google Docs, yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:04
I gotta map it to.

Lem   1:23:05
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, I I I was.
Yeah, this is your persona.
So yeah, you need to map the persona.
Yeah, yeah, I forgot that one.
Yeah. So it's also on my persona, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:17
That's in a couple more of these, right?

Lem   1:23:20
Yeah. On the number number.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:24
3.

Lem   1:23:24
The I think number no.
On #2, it's a #2, yeah.
So the number 2 is the one that's creating the text content.
So we have the persona there. Yeah, that one.
So the first, yeah. Three personas. Yeah. Just pulling out the persona from the.
And then can you just check also the later after that one the Google Doc also the at the last at the end of the.
End of the automation.
So the other, as you can see the last one on the right side, yeah, this one.
So let me just check.
Yeah, I think we're good here. Yep. It's OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:13
Should I know? No. OK.

Lem   1:24:14
Yeah. Yeah. It's just on our. Yeah, on your drive, but yeah.
You should.
Yeah, let's say that for now.
But you you can like add it to a file I on a folder.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:24
Add a folder, yeah.

Lem   1:24:26
Yeah, if you want.
So just upgrade the folder on Google Drive.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:27
Yeah. OK.
Listen, I wanna do that.
I wanna do that for the LinkedIn posting because if you look on here I I just have every time I wanna post a LinkedIn with the articles I gotta I gotta make a folder so it sends all this in there 'cause it's just populating all my stuff so.

Lem   1:24:40
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
So my yeah, the the one that I've, yeah, the one that I've built actually has the like the draft folder and also the completed folder.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:41
I we gotta do that after this.
OK.

Lem   1:24:50
But yeah, we edited it right.
Because we we were having a hard time connecting your.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:54
We are trying to bypass.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember.

Lem   1:24:56
Yeah, yeah. We were trying to bypass it.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:59
OK. Shall I try it now?

Lem   1:24:59
But yeah, yeah, you could try now.
Did yeah, this error out a while ago, OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:14
OK.

Lem   1:25:16
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:18
OK.

Lem   1:25:19
Let's oh it's just.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:20
That's good.

Lem   1:25:22
Yeah.
Then Nope, go to your spreadsheet.
So it would actually populate on the all articles. Yeah this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:31
Yeah.

Lem   1:25:33
So it populated it there and then we have the new filtered articles.
On the filtered articles.
No, not yet.
Not yet so.
There.
Oh, it didn't populate it.
I can you go back to the.
No, the number one.
So we haven't triggered anything here yet.
So.
Can you click?
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:07
Early on to see where messed up.

Lem   1:26:10
Can you?
Can you go back to the history?
So just back, I'll just check the.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:17
How do I look at the history? I go to scenarios.

Lem   1:26:19
Yeah you can.
Yeah, scenarios and then click the this particular scenario, the number one.
And then, yeah, this one just click that one and then at the right side history and then yeah, click the details.
So we could troubleshoot it if what happened there so.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:41
I'm going to my pass through the filter.

Lem   1:26:43
Did it.
Didn't pass right.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:46
No. Yeah, just bundle did not pass the bill to you already.

Lem   1:26:49
Yeah, it didn't pass because we we already have the duplicate for it because we triggered it a while ago.
So that's why it's not passing.
So you could actually just we can reset the the newsletter. You can go back to your spreadsheet.
And then delete all of the on the All articles.
No, no, not here on the all articles.
Yeah. So you can just delete that one.
All of it, yeah.
So that it would be not how the duplicates and then yeah we could trigger this again.
Yep, K.
Yep, so this would be good already.
So a while ago it was actually being filtered out because it's a duplicate.
So it passed.
Yeah, six of the articles passed then.
Yeah, Chipotle is getting it.
So I've added a delay here because we're actually referencing the next step from the.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:59
Right.

Lem   1:28:00
The Yeah, the next step.
So sometimes there's a delay on ChatGPT.
I mean on the Google sheet side, it doesn't like add it directly.
So that's why I've added.
Like delay here.
But yeah, I think it this delay is quite long.
Maybe we could add it like 5 seconds.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:16
It's OK.

Lem   1:28:18
Only.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:18
Yeah, instead of 20.

Lem   1:28:20
Yeah. So.
But yeah, I think I no, we only have 3.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:29
Gotta do 6, right?

Lem   1:28:32
So this is choosing the top three articles.
So it only pass three articles there.
After this finishes, we could go to the the other sheet.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:43
To those sheep.

Lem   1:28:46
Yep, yeah, I think this is good.
Yeah. So in the filter articles, there would be new 3. Adda. There's three after the test, there's three new articles there as you can see.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:57
Yeah.

Lem   1:28:58
So now we could check it, let's say just pick the check mark.
Let's say it's already good.
Yeah, that one, three. And then just remove the.

Bryan Wolf   1:29:08
Try to pick one or all three.

Lem   1:29:13
Yeah you could, because depending on what the article that you yeah, because.

Bryan Wolf   1:29:17
But I want the newsletter.
Let's just do one.

Lem   1:29:21
The first system is we have 3 subsections, so this would actually create the subsection.
So if you just click one, it would only create one.
So you could actually, yeah. On the newsletter. Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   1:29:31
One newsletter.

Lem   1:29:35
So we are. Yeah, we. Yeah, he should do the three, three or because we are actually. Yeah, actually.

Bryan Wolf   1:29:35
So I should do all three.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:00
No, I already processed it.

Lem   1:30:01
No, it's already it's already processed.
So yeah, it's OK, don't click it again.
It will trigger again on the. Yeah. So after you click this after you click the three like 3 check marks there you could just click one yes and it will trigger.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:06
OK.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:30:17
So I would add, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:18

It'll trigger all three of them.

Lem   1:30:20
Yeah, all three of them.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:22
If I have them marked OK.
Alright, so I'm gonna have triple is what you're saying right now on my e-mail.

Lem   1:32:47
Yep.
Yes, good.
Can you just click the back button here on the title?
There's like a.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:10
I'm sorry. Sounds good, brother.
Hey, can you go somewhere else?
I'll talk to you later. Thank you.
Bye. I'm sorry.

Lem   1:33:17
Yep. Our. Yeah, no, no problem on the upper left side.
So there there's like a back buttonope on the title.
Yeah, that one.
And then just go to the show queue because I think it's.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:30
I still can.

Lem   1:33:32
This one so at the right side of there it's because we have the no on the on the.
Yeah, that one then just. Yeah. Delete this one.
All of this. So just yeah.
And then delete.
So and then so that we can test it out again.
Then.
So.
No. Just go back to the spreadsheet. Yeah, sure.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:57
Just number two, try and delete it off, yeah.

Lem   1:34:00
Yeah. So and then go back to the. Oh, no, no, no need.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:04
Should I delete this?

Lem   1:34:04
No need. Just go to the newsletter drafts.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:05
No, no, no, no, no. OK.

Lem   1:34:08
Add the filter.
Yeah, the filter articles and then.
Pick the again the three articles, the check mark.
Yeah, that one.
And then yeah, just delete this first.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:21
Delete the yeses.

Lem   1:34:21
The yeah.
The yes, just backspace.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:23
How do I delete them?
Just like this. OK, great.

Lem   1:34:24
Just uh click, click and yeah, this one, then trigger it again once.
Yeah, delete the process and just trigger it once.
Yet that one.
So that would now.
Yeah, it's processed and then?

Bryan Wolf   1:34:35
OK.

Lem   1:34:37
Let's go to the.
Huh, that's odd.
Can we go back to? It's not populating here. So can you go back to the number 2 again?

Bryan Wolf   1:34:46
OK.

Lem   1:34:49
So let's troubleshoot it.
#2.
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:03
It's running right now.

Lem   1:35:06
Did you?

Bryan Wolf   1:35:07
And I have it on.
Remember I have.
I have these on.

Lem   1:35:11
Oh, right.
So it's just run it, just run now.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:14
Yeah, look, it's running.

Lem   1:35:15
It.
OK.
So there's there's just some.
Oh, did it error out?

Bryan Wolf   1:35:20
Maybe it's just learning now.
See, it's coming in.

Lem   1:35:23
Oh, it says just loading.
Yeah, it's just load just loading. OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:25
Yeah.

Lem   1:35:27
So let's have.
Yeah, we have that now.
And then yeah, we could now access the Google Docs.
So we could check the content text content the other one.
No, the other.
Yeah, that one.
Then just click the. Yeah. Yeah, that that was. Yeah, that's you can delete this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:40
Are these yours? These are yours, huh?
These these first four errors, I can delete these, right?

Lem   1:35:46
Yeah, yeah, just remove row so that OK OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:49
I'll, I'll do it later.
Or wait, remove the yeses.

Lem   1:35:53
No, it should remove the row so that it won't then right click.
Can you right click that one?
And then delete row three to six.
Yes, it's much better to. Yeah, OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:03
Great, great, great. Great, great, great.

Lem   1:36:04
So you have the and then Yep, you can open now.
So yeah, so this is the particular.
Text content.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:12
OK.

Lem   1:36:14
And then let's say that's OK.
Now you can now click yes.
There, OK click.
Yes. So now you would have an, yeah, check your e-mail to send to your e-mail.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:21
Check my e-mail.

Lem   1:36:30
Umm.
So.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:36
Take a minute.

Lem   1:36:37
Maybe it's on, still out on the, so it's still not sent.
Can we?
Can you?

Bryan Wolf   1:36:46
I think it's still loading.

Lem   1:36:48
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:49
It was still loading this stuff in here, I don't know.

Lem   1:36:53
I know the IT would just trigger for this particular row.
Can you just can we check back on make on the make scenario?
Yeah, there and then go to #3.
So we could just check it if it erred out.
So Nope, but it didn't trigger.
So still didn't trigger.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:14
I think what I what we should do is we should delete everything and then I I wanna do it 1 by 1.
I think that would be good instead of automatically.
What do you think I know.

Lem   1:37:24
Yeah, we could actually do that, but it's much better if you could turn it on also to like test it live.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:32
OK, alright.

Lem   1:37:33
But yeah, I think there's there's just some delay on Google's side here.
Just, yeah, there's just some delay on the Google's Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:37
Oh, it's sent.
Yeah, it just takes a little bit, yeah.
Oh, I didn't get.
We just give a couple more minutes.

Lem   1:37:47
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:49
I'm worried because I just turned these on.
Are they running now?

Lem   1:37:53
Yeah, they're they're running. Yep, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:54
They're running again. ****.

Lem   1:37:58
But you actually have the it's actually sent to.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:07
Hmm.

Lem   1:38:08
Can you go back to your?
Yeah, let's troubleshoot it.
The number 3.
This is the #3.
Then yeah, it's actually a success.
So oh, I think this is on brevo side.
There's some delay on brevo side.
Can you?
Let's check it on brevo on the Brevo platform on the Brevo website.
So I think you have it already here on the beside the Gmail.
No, beside the Gmail website, you're ready. Oh, it's OK.
Yep, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:43
What do you mean right here?

Lem   1:38:44
Yeah, this one and then.
You can.
Can you can go to the?
Nope. On the transactional on the left side, transactional.
And here, yeah.
And then yeah, it actually I think it sent it to you and then go.
Down a bit, so it should be on your recent activity.
Think there's just some delay on the?
It's just loading.
Can you go back to the can you go to the logs on the left side?
There's like logs on devil.
Yeah, it actually sent.
Can you see that one?

Bryan Wolf   1:39:27
Nowhere.
Yeah.

Lem   1:39:30
Yeah, this one. So it actually.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:30
So now it should be in my e-mail now.

Lem   1:39:33
Yeah, it should be on e-mail on the can you go to promotions?
Sometimes it goes to the no on the on your Gmail on your Gmail.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:40
Where is she?

Lem   1:39:45
On.
The.
Nope, it's not there, let's say.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:50
I think it's just gonna take a little bit.

Lem   1:39:54
On and we should make updates.
Or maybe if it it's in your spam, can you check your?
Uh.
Oh no, it's not on your spam.
I think it's only yeah, because there's sometimes there's delay on breville, but we will wait for the if it's delivered, can we go back to the BREVO platform? And then yeah, just refresh this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:16
Yeah.

Lem   1:40:22
Yeah, because it's already sent, but it's not being delivered yet.
It's having.
Yeah, I didn't pass through. It's odd.
Uh.
Umm.
Yeah you should.
No, this is a different.
It's the same rate.
Yeah, I think we have a problem here on the.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:10
Mm hmm.
Yeah, it's the same.

Lem   1:41:13
Yeah, it's not sending.
I I think you you can go back to your let me just so that we could test this.
To your previous and then.
Where is the test again?
Let me just.
I think on settings.
Let me just find so that it will e-mail it again.
Settings.
Let me just go back to.
OPS.
Umm.
Just find the one that has the.
This one.
Manage test, test.
Uh.
Of its own settings.
Settings.
Settings.
And then.
Contains.
Oh ****.
Contains settings.
Oh yeah. OK.
So you could go to the campaigns and then.
On the left side of the Bravo.
Campaigns, yeah.
And then click the test set test list.
There would just.
Umm yeah, the no on the on the left side.
So there's like settings there here on the yeah settings, and then click the task list.
Yeah, this one.
They add your e-mail here.
Oh, it's already here, right?
Yeah. Then yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:33
Mm hmm.

Lem   1:43:34
Just click save.
It's odd.
It should actually send on your.
Mail maybe?
Just delay there.
Yeah. So.
Well, we can actually test it again if you want.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:52
Yeah.

Lem   1:43:53
Yeah. So let's go back to your the spreadsheet.
It's actually successfully triggered, but the Brevo site because sometimes Gmail and like the brevo campaigns have like strict rules.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:07
I should I should change this right?
Before we test it again.

Lem   1:44:12
No, we already on the newsletter graphs so.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:15
So just leave it.

Lem   1:44:17
Yeah, just just, David this already good, it's already processed.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:19
For this too.

Lem   1:44:22
Just change the sent.
So delete the sent button.
Yeah, that one.
And then for the yes, just click the backspace for the yes.
So that we can, yeah.
Just box.
Yeah. And then we should, let's figure it again.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:39
So these are on. If I just click this, if I just click this will it run?

Lem   1:44:39
No. No need. Yeah, this.
Yeah, that would.
That would run every 8:00 AM your time if you.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:47
OK.

Lem   1:44:48
Yeah, if you so.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:49
So this this is basically like if I press this on it's basically like me pressing run once.

Lem   1:44:54
No, it would run every, yeah, every day.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:56
8:00 AM every day, OK?

Lem   1:44:57
And 8:00 AM.
Yeah. Because I yeah, you could check the the trigger here on the trigger.
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:05
I should run it.

Lem   1:45:06
You you would run it again? No.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:08
Do you want to? Yeah.

Lem   1:45:10
No, no need.
We could just add on the spreadsheet.
Can you go back to the spreadsheet?
We'll just test the other one.
Yeah, this one.
Because we already have the document or I mean the text content for that particular newsletter.
Yeah. So you just.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:25
So you want me to press yes?

Lem   1:45:26
Yeah, yeah. Press yes.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:28
Yeah.

Lem   1:45:28
So this would trigger the number 3 #3 automation and then.
It would send you an e-mail.
It should send you an e-mail on Bravo.
Yeah, this one.
This would trigger and then it would create the e-mail campaign that send you a test e-mail.
So that's the one that we are want. We want the result to happen. So as you can see, yeah, it's running.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:51
Ronnie.

Lem   1:45:51
So it yeah, it successfully got the trigger.
And then I think it's on the brevo side sometimes.
Yeah, it's.
Because we only have the free account and then.
Like a personal Gmail.
So I I think it it's being soft bounce.
Yeah, it's. I think it's already.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:19
Delivered.

Lem   1:46:20
Yeah, it's delivered.
Can you check your e-mail?

Bryan Wolf   1:46:21
Ah, we got both of them now.
We got both of them nice.

Lem   1:46:22
Yeah, yeah. It's some delays there.
But yeah, basically that would be, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:29
Nice, great.

Lem   1:46:32
Yeah, that's it.
So if it's already good now you could trigger the other one the go back to the spreadsheet.
So if the formatting is right, yeah, you could click the next again. So as you can see there no, just go back to the.
Yeah, the send final.
Yeah, that one.
So it would send to your e-mail again actually. So you have on the list.
So that would send again.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:57
Oh, they're gone now.

Lem   1:46:57
Us.
They're.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:01
It's gotta be my spam.

Lem   1:47:02
Yeah, I think it's on the.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:04
Yeah, it is on spam.
Can I change that?

Lem   1:47:07
Yeah, you could actually change that.
And it's on spam or it's on.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:14
Yeah, it's. Yeah, it's, it's, it's on all mail.

Lem   1:47:15
I think it's on.
No, no, no.
It's on, I think from it's on promotions I think or on updates, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:18
But when I go to my inbox it's not here.
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:47:23
So that's the as you can see there the serrala one, that's the particular e-mail.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:26
It's all up to date.
It's all updates.

Lem   1:47:29
Oh, it's an updates, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:29
OK. Yeah.

Lem   1:47:30
So yeah, as you can see, the cirala one, that's the one that sent by the. Yeah. Yeah, that one.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:34
Is yes. OK. Wow. So why is he called serrala 'cause? We set it up like that.

Lem   1:47:37
Yeah.
Yeah, the subject I've set it up.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:41
OK. Because we want this to force. Yeah, OK all right.

Lem   1:47:44
As yeah, but you can.
Yeah, you can edit the subject.
On the.
So.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:52
Yeah. So since I don't want this type of article that's in my inbox reader, right?

Lem   1:47:58
Yeah.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:00
So really I just need to make this a little bit more AI and finance impact.

Lem   1:48:04
Yeah, that's right. Yep, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:04
So that way I don't get stuff like this. OK. All right. OK, cool.

Lem   1:48:06
Yep, that's right. Yeah.
So yeah, the the one that we we can control here is the one that article's coming from inoreader. And then yeah, that's it.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:19
Yeah.

Lem   1:48:21
And then for the content also we could check we could actually check it here for the test e-mail right on the number.
Oh, no, I I mean, what I mean is on the can you go back to our spreadsheet.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:29
Where?
Like here like I can check it here.

Lem   1:48:35
That one, yeah.
And then yeah, on the filter articles, you could actually check because we just test it out for like, but you can actually check the web.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:36
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
Yeah, this one is the one I don't want. But yeah, I got you.
I can just check it like this.

Lem   1:48:45
Yeah, yeah, you could.
Yeah, that's that's right.
Yeah, you could just check it one by one, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:49
OK.
Great. Alright, great. OK, great. OK.
So now listen, I'm gonna we gotta.
I gotta do this all again.
We're gonna set this up for Peter now, though.

Lem   1:48:56
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:10
OK.

Lem   1:49:26
And then you can like to understand it better.
Also you can like check the modules or nodes 1 by 1.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:32
Mm hmm.

Lem   1:49:33
Yeah. So you can actually, yeah, because I haven't.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:33
Yeah.

Lem   1:49:36
I've just like explained it like like an overview on the long video, right?
Or or here on our session.
So there are like little nuances there that you can see if you check the like the outputs the inputs on every module.
So Yep, basically that would also be so that you can understand because if you can like understand already the like the flow of it where you can like manipulate the data and stuff, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:00
Uh huh.

Lem   1:50:02
You can do a lot of things on this automation, so yeah, that's that would be also plus the plus side here could manipulate it however we want.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:15
OK.
So now I'm gonna go to.
Second, I got.

Lem   1:50:21
Umm.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:25
On oh, wait, So what is?
What is this?
This is the code you sent right here.

Lem   1:50:32
Pardon.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:34
Hold on.
Let me just.

Lem   1:50:35
I can't see the.
If you duplicate the the spreadsheet, you could actually copy also the script, so that would actually. Yeah, it would also be copied, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:51
Be better.

Lem   1:50:53
So if you make a copy and then just, yeah, rename it so that it be, it's won't be get confusing.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:19
Oh, this is my account. I can't stand how it does this.

Lem   1:51:26
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:28
OK.
Hold on.

Lem   1:51:29
Yeah, I think I need to.
You need to open the share link for.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:33
Yeah, but so look, when it goes to my account, when I do it.
See.

Lem   1:51:39
Oh, I see. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:41
See here we go. Now I got no, I got.

Lem   1:51:42
So, OK, OK Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:46
This is it right?
This is all, yeah.

Lem   1:51:49
Yeah.
That's.
Yeah, that's the my, my my account.

Bryan Wolf   1:52:00
Yeah, let me copy.

Lem   1:52:02
Make a copy? Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:52:15

Can answer my it's just weird 'cause I have to friggin do everything on a private browser.

Lem   1:52:32
Oh yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:52:32
OK.

The one that would be confusing was the Google Apps script.

Bryan Wolf   1:56:30
Yeah.

Lem   1:56:31
Yeah. So it would be, yeah.
That bad books.
So.
I can just actually.
Mission.

Why are you?

Bryan Wolf   1:56:53
I create a data structure right?

Lem   1:56:55
