Lem   1:10
Hi, guys.
Yeah, I was. I was good.

Bryan Wolf   1:19
All is good.

Peter Wolf   1:19
Hey.
So can we just start off with Brian?
Let my stuff isn't working, at least as far as I can tell.

Bryan Wolf   1:28
What stuff, dad?

Peter Wolf   1:30
Yeah, the sending the research.
Let's start with that. The research e-mail.

Bryan Wolf   1:34
I literally we just did the extra day.
I just fixed it yesterday.

Peter Wolf   1:39
I just ran it this morning.

Lem   1:40
The.

Peter Wolf   1:41
I ran it last night. It's not working.
Unless I'm doing something wrong.

Lem   1:55
I think because that particular automation is actually.
Triggering every like 15 minutes, so there's some.
I think there's some delay on.

Peter Wolf   2:08
I sent.

Lem   2:08
Whenever you.

Peter Wolf   2:09
I sent.
I sent several last night.
I sent several this morning and as far as I can tell, there's still nothing in there.

Lem   2:13
OK.

Peter Wolf   2:15
So it should've.

Bryan Wolf   2:17
Excuse me? Certainly.

Peter Wolf   2:24
Yeah, there's still nothing in the folder.

Peter Wolf Jr   2:30
Good morning, gentlemen.

Peter Wolf   2:32
OK.

Lem   2:33
Morning.
Yeah. So I I also added like a prompt of the day on the newsletter if.

Peter Wolf   3:00
Yeah. Can we just, can we just hold on, focus on this first.
I need to get something working so I can actually use some of this stuff instead of keep pushing forward, I need to get something working.

Lem   3:07
OK, OK.
No problem.

Bryan Wolf   3:13
It works like we can put it.

Peter Wolf   3:15
OK. Can you show me Brae? Show me what you're doing.

Lem   3:17
Uh.
I think, yeah, it's on the Google sheet on your.
Account. Yeah. On the Google Drive.

Peter Wolf   3:25
OK, then I'm looking at the wrong Google sheet.
Here's my sheet right now.

Bryan Wolf   3:28
Oh.

Peter Wolf   3:33
I just went into my Google Drive. Here's my Google Drive.

Lem   3:36
OK.

Peter Wolf   3:38
Into the automations folder.
Here's the data research Google Sheet.

Lem   3:46
So yeah, it's Part 2.

Peter Wolf   3:49
And this is got two things in it that aren't mine that I did not send.

Bryan Wolf   3:53
Yeah, I sent them. Yes, there.

Peter Wolf   3:55
Yeah. OK.

Lem   3:55
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   3:57
But then, here's here's emails that I sent last night and this morning. Hold on.

Bryan Wolf   4:00
Hello.
OK.

Lem   4:03
Oh, I think it's still turned off.

Peter Wolf   4:03
All these 945 last night, 937 last night.

Bryan Wolf   4:08
Yep.

Peter Wolf   4:08
So 1001.

Lem   4:13
Yeah, I think it's still turned off the automation.
That's why it didn't pick up the.
This particular e-mail emails.
We can check the.
Yeah, the one on this account.

Peter Wolf   5:36
Right. Can you share your screen or what are you doing?

Bryan Wolf   6:03
There you go. Now it should work.

Peter Wolf   6:07
How often is it triggering?
Because if it should work, then let's kick it off manually right now.

Bryan Wolf   6:14
I didn't have it on.
I didn't have it on.

Peter Wolf   6:17
OK. Can you trigger it to to run right now?
Because I have multiple in there, it should pick them all up.

Bryan Wolf   6:20
Yep, yes.
And do you know why it stopped at 1:00?
Here's the way to start.
Let's do a select the first thing.

Peter Wolf   6:48
Len, when he's triggering him manually, how should he do it there?

Bryan Wolf   6:52
It's it's good. I got it. Sorry.

Lem   7:10
Alright, I'm I think.
Yeah, it would.
It would.
This would get all the emails, the task research subject line so.
Including the.

Bryan Wolf   7:21
There's three as of right now.

Lem   7:23
Yep, this is third.
Still running.

Bryan Wolf   7:27
Yeah, let's put them in there.
There's no website URL.
So whatever.
This one is. There's two in there, there's 135.
There's one for Google Docs, OK?
Well, these ones aren't very.

Peter Wolf   7:38
No, that's that's that's good.
That's, I mean it should be finding that stuff out, right?

Bryan Wolf   7:43
Yes.

Lem   7:43
Yeah, the because it's include including the one the other like emails that have research on the subject lines.

Peter Wolf   7:44
So.

Lem   7:50
So we could just.

Peter Wolf   7:51
Yep, Yep.

Lem   7:52
Yeah, we could just delete that one.
But yeah, but yeah, I think this already working if we will like activate this every like 15 minutes or every one hour.
So yeah, it will automatically get.

Peter Wolf   8:05
And so how much?
How much drainage?
How much?
How much issue does that have? We run that to look.
It depends on how many emails are there, right?
If we say only look for the last the last day or something that it won't look through so many.

Lem   8:15
Yep.

Peter Wolf   8:18
So we'll use many tokens.

Bryan Wolf   8:18
OK.
Well, hold on here, Len.
Look at this.
This is like.
This does this a lot on the other negotiator too. I feel like like this is just no way.
This is the real link.
It's just so big.

Peter Wolf   8:32
But it it must have had the word research in it and I.

Lem   8:34
Yeah, this is Cancer Research. As you can see on the subject line.

Peter Wolf   8:38
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   8:38
Yeah.

Lem   8:39
That's why it's we could actually like trigger it via different keyword so that it won't be like the same on other e-mail.

Peter Wolf   8:49
Right. So it makes something more unique like my research or something.

Lem   8:51
But yeah, like, yeah, yeah, like that.
Or let's say our like research plus because I think our research on word research plus.

Peter Wolf   8:56
OK.
Yeah, let's do that. Since we did that for the news, the newsletter plus right or something.

Lem   9:02
Yeah, yeah.
And just one word research plus.
And then, yeah, I think it would be better.
So yeah, it's still running and getting all of the emails from. I think the first one.

Peter Wolf   9:14
Yeah.

Lem   9:14
So I think we could just stop this one.

Peter Wolf   9:15
Yeah. Can we cancel it now?

Lem   9:16
Yeah. And just.

Peter Wolf   9:17
'Cause there's. I was only looking for the beginning.

Lem   9:19
So if we trigger this now, I mean if we like turn this on now.
It will actually get all all the like new emails so it it will just process the new emails on the.

Peter Wolf   9:31
OK.
So let's turn it on.
So it's only new emails. It will look from the last time it checked, right?
Or what?
When it runs, we'll just look for the last 15 minutes or the last time it ran.

Lem   9:44
Yeah, that's right. Let's say it.
We will start it from now and then it will get all of the emails that has subject line research starting from like that particular point of time where we like.

Bryan Wolf   9:56
OK.

Lem   9:59
Turned it on.
So yeah, it won't process the like the old ones.

Peter Wolf   10:07
OK. And can we see how much this is using just I have no, no real idea of this.

Lem   10:12
Yeah, we could actually.

Peter Wolf   10:14
I'm trying to make sure I'm getting understanding of whether I'm draining the credits and whether it's an issue or not right.

Lem   10:20
Yep, we, we we could check the history.

Bryan Wolf   10:21
For sure, I think it was during the first.
For this one.

Lem   10:26
The Yeah, this this, the one running right?
The one that ran. Yeah. And then get new.
Check.
The.
Details.
And then on the right side, yeah, so Yep.
So for this one, we could see that every run it would consume 12345677 operations.
Per run or per link that you will send your e-mail.
So that's the yeah, that is.

Peter Wolf   10:58
And what do we have?

Bryan Wolf   10:58
Where do you see that?
Where do you see that?
Where do you see that? I'm going to differentiate.

Peter Wolf   11:01
For.

Lem   11:03
I'm just counting the like the modules that has like the bubble. So as you can see there there's ten nine because it's processing all of the research, research, subject lines. But if it's just one link it would just pass through there and it will consume one operation per.

Bryan Wolf   11:04
Like.
Oh, until then.

Lem   11:19
Node. So that's like per module. So that's how it we can like track the consume of operations.

Peter Wolf   11:29
And so how many?

Lem   11:29
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   11:30
What is the make?
How many do we have per account?
And we have a we have a team account, right?

Bryan Wolf   11:34
How many?

Lem   11:34
For the the Pro plan, yeah, you have 10,000 operations per month for like the.

Bryan Wolf   11:36
Watt mm hmm.

Peter Wolf   11:42
OK.
So we're we're we don't have anything to worry about.

Lem   11:43
The $9 plus.
Yeah. So it will.
Yeah, if you like, send the I think the one that consumes like big operation is this newsletter because it's like a five step five step process and then it's pretty complex.
So, but this particular like automations will just consume.
A little operations here these systems.

Peter Wolf   12:06
So there's no quick way other than you scanning it like that. There's no way to see how many operations are in there.
There's no no header or or you know calculator that says, oh, this, this process flow has 20 operations. You have to do it manually.

Lem   12:20
Yeah, yeah. If we like trigger the whole scenario and then it it turns to success.
So we could just see the history. And then there's actually a total.
Let me open.

Peter Wolf   12:32
Yeah, he was just in there.
I saw something that showed like an 18. Or can you go back over Brian?

Lem   12:35
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that there has like the.
The like the wheel, something on the history.
You can check the like the particular automation so that yeah.

Peter Wolf   12:48
And what are those numbers in those boxes?
There mean plus 18 + 24.

Lem   12:54
Uh.

Peter Wolf   12:55
We'll go back in a second, but right there.
What's that?
1-2 and there's an 18th and 19 and 20.
Are those sequential numbers or what?

Lem   13:05
I these are the numbers for the module. So because.
Let's say chat.
There's like 2 ChatGPT.
So the one.
The first ChatGPT will be, let's say ChatGPT one and then the other one will be ChatGPT 2.
And then that's the like the number on the box there and then the.

Peter Wolf   13:22
But was it extract summary 20?
It's the 20th iteration of that or 20th example of extract information we have.

Lem   13:31
It's like it's number is from actually like the first module that is made.
So it's just like a unique identifier, like a UUID, no?

Bryan Wolf   13:38
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   13:41
Across all of our flows, we have 20 that we've created that are that are extract data for a spreadsheet or something.

Lem   13:48
No, just here on the this particular like diagram.
So it will just the number.

Peter Wolf   13:53
I know, but there's one extract summary. It says 20.

Lem   13:57
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   13:58
So that's the 20th example of ChatGPT extract summary.

Lem   13:59
It's.

Peter Wolf   14:01
I don't think so.
Not in this one flow.

Lem   14:03
No, just the ChatGPT.
It's counting the ChatGPT modules that we've added here.

Peter Wolf   14:11
Total in.

Lem   14:11
And then.

Peter Wolf   14:11
All in all our flows, because there's not 20 there for sure, there's 123456.

Lem   14:15
Yeah, there's just.
And then yeah, basically that's this includes I think the.
This includes the other.
Like if we create. Yeah. No, no, not the just this particular diagram sometimes because let's say we I add a new one, then I deleted it.

Peter Wolf   14:27
The other process flows.

Lem   14:36
It will actually also be included on that, like on the numbering, yeah.

Peter Wolf   14:40
OK.
So when we're talking to each other and we wanna talk about ChatGPT, say, oh, I'm talking about ChatGPT 20 or ChatGPT 19 or ChatGPT 2.

Lem   14:49
The yeah, it would be.

Peter Wolf   14:50
For reference.

Lem   14:52
I think it would be pretty confusing.
That's why it's better if we like name it after we built it. That particular module we named it so that it will be easier.

Peter Wolf   15:02
Right. So like you have extract website URL in the first one extract title, extract summary.

Lem   15:05
Yes, that's right.
Yeah, it's much easier to cross reference, yeah.

Peter Wolf   15:08
Yeah, obviously the the name should be unique. OK.

Bryan Wolf   15:09
Yeah.

Lem   15:12
Yeah, because the if the default here is is just like create a completion prompt on ChatGPT and then there's a number.

Peter Wolf   15:18
OK.
But given that we just ran this successfully, then can't we look at the history and you were saying we could see how many operations?

Lem   15:22
Yep.
Yes. Yes, we could see on the history as you can see, this is our 56 operations on the right hand side and also in the history.

Peter Wolf   15:33
That we've run total that we've run this month or that's not one iteration.

Lem   15:35
Yeah. No, just this particular because it processed like 10 emails that has research.
So this particular run it consumed 56 operations.

Bryan Wolf   15:48
Oh.

Peter Wolf   15:48
So it really did consume 56 operations because every iteration when it has another article or something, it's it's considering an operation.

Lem   15:48
And we could.
Yep.
Yes, that's right.
Yeah, so whenever, let's say there's a one link so it will pass through all the modules, right?
So there's if there's another link, so the second link will pass through again to the all modules. Yeah, so that that's why it.

Peter Wolf   16:05
Yep.
Yep, Yep.
OK. And if there's nothing there when it checks and all it really did was the operation of checking.
That's only one operation.

Lem   16:15
Yep. Yeah, that's right.
So it will just be one operation. Yep. So let's say we trigger this hourly.
So there will be like 24 operations for that every every day. Because, yeah.
Yeah, for the.

Peter Wolf   16:29
Now, where did you get 24? If there were links?
If there was one link right now.

Lem   16:34
Yeah, if there's one link, yeah, we would be 23 + 7.
So that would be 30 operations for that particular day.

Peter Wolf   16:42
Tell me.
Tell me where you're coming up with the 23 + 7.
I don't understand that.

Lem   16:46
Because we we would be.
This would trigger every R and then if there's no research.

Peter Wolf   16:53
OK.
So you're saying how many times per day?
But I'm saying one run, one run in one execution. How many?

Lem   16:57
Yep, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   17:01
Is it? You're saying that was seven steps and you're saying 23 times or 24 times a day?

Lem   17:07
No. If we turn this automation on so it will trigger every R and then it will check the your Gmail inbox. If there's a new.
E-mail that has the subject line research and then if there's no, yeah, it will stop.

Peter Wolf   17:20
Right. And if there's no.
If there's no research, then it only did the one check.
That's one operation, right?

Lem   17:24
Yes, that.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   17:26
But if there is one, then it will run through the entire process.

Lem   17:26
Yeah, just one operation, yeah.
Yep, Yep, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   17:31
And you're saying, how many are we saying? It's in the process. We look for the true steps.
So it's the first step.
The second step.

Lem   17:36
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   17:37
Disregard the router.

Lem   17:39
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   17:40
The redirect and the perplexity.
That's four extract and research extract.

Lem   17:44
Yep.
And.
Also the filter, so it's would be 123456780. It's yeah, it would be 9:00 because we also have the filter so it it would actually consume operation for the two filters. So that would be 9 operations for this one so one.
2/3.

Peter Wolf   18:05
Which ones are the filters?
The the router no.

Lem   18:09
Yeah, the there's like a small funnel. Yeah, this one.

Peter Wolf   18:12
Ah.

Lem   18:13
Yeah. So this these are filtering.
For example, this filter is.
It won't continue if it is empty.
So now it's. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   18:20
But that's an operation.

Lem   18:22
So if if it's not empty, it would consume one operation. Because yeah, we we are stopping the operation, right?
If it's empty, so that's why I've added that filter there.

Peter Wolf   18:32
Great bride. Do you understand that?
Peter, do you guys understand that filter thing? OK.

Bryan Wolf   18:36
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   18:38
Yeah. So the filter is depending on also the use case. So you could also add every path there.
We could add the filter depending on our logic of the automation.

Peter Wolf   18:51
And the filter, we're saying what we're we're excluding things that we don't want or only including things that have that title, the research title, right.

Lem   18:51
So yeah.
Uh.
Yes, that's right, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.
We could.

Peter Wolf   19:00
OK.

Lem   19:01
Yeah, we could like filter it out to just include that particular data or exclude the data that it won't pass through there that particular filter.
So it would depend on the.

Peter Wolf   19:09
Right. So Brian, can we change mine to put the plus sign after? So the word it's looking for is research plus.

Lem   19:16
Yeah, it would be there.

Peter Wolf   19:17
That way we don't get the junk.

Lem   19:20
They're on the filter here on Gmail. On the diagram, you could just add.
The.
Nope. Here on the Gmail module the first one.

Bryan Wolf   19:31
Right on on.

Peter Wolf   19:32
No, no A+ sign.

Lem   19:33
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   19:33
Say that again.

Peter Wolf   19:34
A plus sign, Brian.
Just a plus sign right up against research. Yep.

Lem   19:37
Yep.
Yep, so this would be yeah, research plus.

Peter Wolf   19:45
And that could be anywhere in it, right?
Research plus is anywhere in the title or done not be right up front, OK.

Lem   19:49
Yeah. Yes, that's right.
Yeah, it could be anywhere in the title.
And then.

Bryan Wolf   19:56
All emails, right?

Lem   19:58
Just no, I just clicked the from now on.
Yeah, from now on.
So that would start.

Peter Wolf   20:03
So every time it checks, it's only going to check since the last time it had one, right?

Lem   20:07
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   20:08
And.

Lem   20:08
And then the the clock here I I think the trigger here is every 15 minutes.
We could just change this to everyone R so that it won't consume consume too much operation. So at regular.

Peter Wolf   20:17
That's great. Yep.

Lem   20:23
Yeah, just 60 minutes.
Yeah, this would.
This would be also then OK, we can now activate this one activate scenario.
Yeah. OK.
So this would this should work already and then it will just consume one operation every hour if there's no. Yeah. Yeah. No e-mail on your inbox that has research and plus sign.
So Yep.

Peter Wolf   20:44
OK.
So I'm gonna just run one test myself here.
I know it's not gonna check for 15 minutes, but while we're on the call, it should find it.

Lem   20:50
Yep.
We could.

Peter Wolf   20:52
Hold on a second.

Lem   20:53
Yeah, we could actually.
Just manually trigger it just to test, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   20:55
When you run it, yeah.

Peter Wolf   20:57
Well, no. I would just like to see it run normal if we, that's all. I just want to plug one in.

Lem   21:00
Oh yeah, we could, we could.
You could actually change Bryan the trigger here to let's say 5 minutes.

Peter Wolf   21:07
OK. That way we know it comes up faster sooner.

Lem   21:08
So that yeah, yes, that's right.

Peter Wolf   21:10
Yeah. And then we can change it back.

Lem   21:10
Yeah, the 5 minutes.

Peter Wolf   21:12
OK, give me one second here.

Lem   21:12
So it would.
Trigger after 5 minutes.
And then.
Yep. And then yeah, we could actually like delete this like junk something here.

Bryan Wolf   21:26
Yeah. So like, look, some of these.

Lem   21:28
So that we could.

Peter Wolf   21:29
Yeah, I know. Don't worry about them, all right?

Bryan Wolf   21:31
You want to delete them.

Lem   21:32
Yeah, it's from the past emails, I think.

Peter Wolf   21:33
Yeah, you can delete them.
It's all junk.
I'm I'm just testing it.
It's all junk.
Hold on one SEC.

Bryan Wolf   21:54
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   22:52
OK.
I I sent it.
So then let's let's move on to looking at the newsletter stuff where we are.

Lem   22:58
OK.

Bryan Wolf   23:00
Well, I don't know if this is gonna do one e-mail or it's gonna do a bunch again, but.

Peter Wolf   23:04
It's gonna what?

Bryan Wolf   23:06
I read it.

Peter Wolf   23:07
Which?

Lem   23:09
Is just one because we did it a while ago. From now on. Yeah, I think it triggered it.
You you click the run once.

Bryan Wolf   23:18
Yeah.

Lem   23:18
Yeah, it.
Yeah, it.
Oh, I see. I see.
Yeah, yeah, this is the one U.S. bank.

Bryan Wolf   23:22
Should I just let it sit?
Yeah.

Lem   23:28
Yeah. So yeah, this one.

Peter Wolf   23:30
OK, great. All right.
Good.

Lem   23:34
And then, yeah, we, we should change also the trigger again because this was set to, yeah, 60 minutes.

Bryan Wolf   23:39
15 minutes.
Oh ****, I just unplug something. ****.

Lem   23:43
Because it will consume too much operation.
If yeah, just the trigger.

Peter Wolf   23:48
And the other the other header I used was newsletter plus right?

Lem   23:54
Yeah, the newsletter plus has the like plus word newsletter plus one word, just one word newsletter and then plus.

Peter Wolf   23:58
Yep.
OK.

Lem   24:03
So it will add to the articles.

Peter Wolf   24:06
Yep, I'm gonna run that right now too.

Lem   24:07
On.

Peter Wolf   24:08
Is that activated for my account, Brian?

Lem   24:09
The.

Bryan Wolf   24:10
Well, yeah.
Yes, so.

Lem   24:26
It's the. Yeah, it's a zero new 3 newsletter plus. So it's already on.

Peter Wolf   24:45
The letter I just sent.

Lem   24:57
Can we check this newsletter?
Plus Brian, if for the just the trigger.
Yeah, let's check if the trigger is correct.
Maybe this is. Yeah. It's running every 15 minutes, so I think we should also change this to one hour.
So yeah, 60 minutes.
Besides consuming every 15 minutes, just click save.
Yep, this should be good.
And then.
Yeah. So as you can see, the history has like one operations.
Yeah, every 15 minutes.

Bryan Wolf   25:35
That was not good.

Lem   25:35
So it was.

Bryan Wolf   25:36
It's been off like a dare, chill like that.

Lem   25:38
Yeah, it was running every 15 seconds and then.
Since I think, yeah, June 20.

Peter Wolf   25:46
Every 15 seconds.

Bryan Wolf   25:48
15 minutes.

Lem   25:49
15 minutes. Yeah, so it was.
Wasn't change.

Peter Wolf   25:53
OK, so I sent one of those.
So let's look at what changes you've made and then we'll see what triggered here, where we're at on the newsletter.

Lem   26:02
OK.
For the.

Bryan Wolf   26:07
Yeah, I'll stop sharing.

Lem   26:10
OK, I'll I'll share my screen now.
OK.
Yeah, so I've added this.
Like another research for the like, the automation tools, updates and then also for viral prompts. And then I've added a particular 2 new sections here also.
So we have it here and then I also fixed the the formatting for the.
This one.
So the formatting I've already fixed, so the ChatGPT won't.
Let me just, yeah, this one, so the formatting.

Peter Wolf   26:58
What's that?
Whole megabytes thing at the bottom there limits comes up that little chart.

Lem   27:02
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   27:03
Where this?

Lem   27:04
This. Oh, this is just the operations, operations and data transfer like.

Peter Wolf   27:09
So that's telling me how many operations we've done on a given day.

Lem   27:12
Yep, that's right. Yeah.
So like for example this one June 19, it consumed 24 operations.
So you could also track it here.
If yeah, it's the it's history and then, yeah, so the the final.

Peter Wolf   27:21
OK.

Lem   27:29
Yeah, the final e-mail would be like like this.
So if tested it several times, so I've just added this like the Serrala banner as placeholder and then and then something like this will come back.

Peter Wolf   27:37
Nice.

Lem   27:40
We also have like the line here.
And then for the today's insight, it will just add like insights for the news.

Peter Wolf   27:48
Summarizing or looking at what's in the content. Yeah. OK.

Lem   27:51
Yeah, yeah, yes, that's right.
Like the news and like the social media, the viral post and also the tools updates. So we have here now the AI finance news.
So we could add however we want.
So I I just added three so this is the first one. This is second one.

Peter Wolf   28:06
Yep.

Lem   28:07
This is the third one.
And then now we have the social signals, and then we have the trendings on social this week.

Bryan Wolf   28:12
Oh great.

Lem   28:15
We can then, yeah, this is the if you click this one it will.
It would go to the particular link in post.
So this is the link in post from Pasco.

Peter Wolf   28:22
Love it perfect. This is awesome. Yeah.

Lem   28:26
And then, yeah, so I also have for Reddit. I think this is the Reddit one. Yeah. So this is the Reddit one for Twitter. I I'm having a hard time finding like other endpoint is now very strict.
So we have to pay like $250 per month for that. And then I've also like research on.
Happy 5.
So they also don't have like a Twitter scraper there.
So I would need to find another way for the Twitter.
So these are just coming from LinkedIn and Reddit for now. And then yes, OK.

Peter Wolf   28:58
OK.
I'm OK with that.
I'm OK with that.
LinkedIn is the professional area anyway, so I can.

Lem   29:04
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   29:05
I'm fine with that for now. We'll figure something out if if we can.

Lem   29:06
Yes then.

Peter Wolf   29:09
If not, maybe I pay. What did you say?
It's 20, some dollars per month.

Lem   29:13
Yeah, it the there like basic plan I think is for the developer portal is $250 I think to access there.

Peter Wolf   29:22
Oh, $250.

Lem   29:24
Yeah, $250 per month.

Bryan Wolf   29:25
Yeah.

Lem   29:26
Yeah. So it's a pretty, pretty steep, yes.

Peter Wolf   29:26
Oh, OK.
I don't think I want those articles that bad.

Bryan Wolf   29:30
No.

Lem   29:30
Yeah. So it's really steep. Yeah. So Yep.
And then next is the AI tools and updates.
So I've added it also here and then if we click this one it will also go to that particular link.
For this article and then.

Peter Wolf   29:44
This is this is great.
This is really great.

Lem   29:48
This is the prompt, so I've also researched like the prompt prompt of the day. So this is the like the prompt and then I've also added the title as applicable links. So if you click this one it will also get to the go to the particular where.

Peter Wolf   30:05
OK.
So this was this is a little bit different than I was thinking, but you're saying you you went out and searched.

Lem   30:06
Prompt, go go.

Peter Wolf   30:10
Where are you searching for the prompt of the day?

Lem   30:12
Yeah. So for the prompt of the day, I also used.
I also actually used ChatGPT 40, this one so 3 viral prompts last week from last week and then yeah, just extracting.

Peter Wolf   30:23
Yeah.

Lem   30:30
So it would we we could also choose this one. I've added it to the data database, then Google Sheets.
So now we could actually choose that particular prompt.
So I just choose here.
But we could check the prompts if what?

Peter Wolf   30:44
Ready.

Lem   30:46
We will what we want to add. So you could just see here.

Peter Wolf   30:51
OK. We were talking about manually being able to add 1 if I if I had created or if we just went to ChatGPT and came up with our own. Right, because I came up with a couple about searching the volatility and foreign currency markets or interest rates.

Bryan Wolf   30:55
OK.

Lem   30:56
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   31:04
So I could.
This wouldn't be that easy. I mean that hard to come up with some good ones because to me, I want them to be really pretty specific to treasury finance and be able to allow them to do that externally.

Lem   31:05
Oh, OK, yeah.
Yep.
Yep.
Oh, right, right. Yeah. So yeah, for that one, because I think this is a pretty generic prompts that are being researched like a viral pronounce. Of course this would be like on image or let's say like content.
So you could actually, if you want to add it manually, you could also add it actually.
Here just put like the prompt title here and then the complete prompt here and then if the URL you could just put put it empty as empty then yeah just.

Peter Wolf   31:39
OK.
How many character limit is there for a cell in in Google Sheets?

Lem   31:54
Of character you mean for this one?

Peter Wolf   31:56
Yeah. How many characters cause XL has something like 255?

Lem   31:57
Yeah.
I'm not sure how many.

Peter Wolf   32:01
And I had created some some some prompts that were really I wanted them to look really impressive. A lot of details, a lot of you know, specifics.
So it wouldn't be something relatively short, it might be.

Lem   32:09
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   32:12
Let me just look at the one I had created the other day. Hold on.

Lem   32:12
Yep.
But if if it's a very long, what would happen also on our e-mail is like this would be like very long like it will take like a lots of space.

Peter Wolf   32:24
Yeah, OK. But let me ask you something too that see the way that's presented there was that presented in the content in that kind of white on black or is that some a rendition that you have through?

Lem   32:25
Yeah. So that would also.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, this is just a rendition on the HTML code to yeah, to put it on this particular.

Peter Wolf   32:39
The.
Oh, that's nice.
I like that though.
I like that.

Peter Wolf Jr   32:44
Hey Nicky, I'm thinking.
I think it's something like.
5000 characters on sheet like you get a whole it can hold.

Peter Wolf   32:51
On a Google sheet.

Peter Wolf Jr   32:53
I believe I'm about to look it up, but I believe it's something like 5000 characters.

Peter Wolf   32:59
Yeah, hold one second.
Let me find my let me let me find the the one that I came up with and let's plug that in and see how it works, because it would have to also do the summary part right. And that would have already been done if we plug it in.
And we need an image or something.
You have the way you have it.
You have some kind of image there, right?
Or not an image, but a title.

Lem   33:19
This one.

Peter Wolf   33:21
Let me just let me find my let me first find this and then we'll go from there.

Lem   33:21
Yeah, the title.

Peter Wolf   33:26
Got too many screens open.

Peter Wolf Jr   33:36
50,000 characters.

Peter Wolf   33:38
In a Google sheet individual cell.

Peter Wolf Jr   33:38
I just.
I just looked at.
The maximum number of characters allowed the single cell in Google Sheets is 50,000 characters. However, if you're aware of the practical consideration of storyboard text based on only 1024 characters will be visible in the cell without using the formula bar or expanding with cell.

Lem   33:42
15.

Peter Wolf   33:47
Wow, OK.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK.
OK here.
Let's try this.
I'm gonna plug this into the chat here if you can.
Or no, I don't know if I have that spreadsheet.
Is that spreadsheet on mine? Or let me put it in the chat and you can plug it in. Hold on.

Lem   34:14
OK.
So I would be adding it.

Peter Wolf   34:48
You know what this actually says?
What they should do, I have to tweet this a little bit, like the number one bullet here in the chat. If you see it says identify the top three currency pairs your company is exposed to.
It's making it refined to them and then just as an example, but let's see when you plug that in like that, let's see if someone cut that whole thing and plugged it into the sheet or replug it into the sheet, what would happen?
Let me plug.
I'm gonna plug that into ChatGPT. I already did that yesterday, but.

Lem   35:16
Oh, the this one.
I will add it to the.

Peter Wolf   35:21
To the spreadsheet, right?

Lem   35:22
Out of the spreadsheet OK.
Here.
Oh wait.
Yes, it would.
Yeah, it's not.
Adding the.
Like the 1234.
It's.

Peter Wolf   35:48
Yes, that's a problem.
I really wanted to look very structured right?
Not a big because I want them to be able to, even if they don't use the prompt, I want them to look at the prompt and see. Oh yeah, that's very detailed and all that.
So if it's all just one big run on it will be hard for them to consume.

Lem   36:04
Yeah, that that's right.

Peter Wolf   36:05
So structuring it is going to be important.

Lem   36:13
Checked in.

Peter Wolf   36:15
Well, let's just see.
Save that in there, and let's let's pull it in and see what it looks like.

Lem   36:20
Yeah, but I think it's the problem.
Here is the copy pasting of here, but let me just add it this I think.
Identify.
Platforms to use.
Oh, this one, OK.
So I think this would also.
Work for suggest.
This is for the title.
OK.
Then.
So I I will run it again or.

Peter Wolf   37:12
Yeah, but, but don't you?

Lem   37:13
OK.
So let's.

Peter Wolf   37:14
What's going to happen if it doesn't have a URL?
Well, let's see, I guess.

Lem   37:18
Yeah, we we could, I think.
Yeah, not sure if you would error out, but we could try it for now just to test so.
Filtered articles.
That's good.

Nicholas Westburg   37:34
Morning.

Lem   37:34
So I'm I'm removing the process here so that it would process again the.

Peter Wolf   37:36
Yeah.
Yep.

Lem   37:42
So this one is good.
OK.
Then.
Yep.
So it would.
Yeah, I need to trigger the other one.
So I just trigger it manually using the web hook and then yeah it's processing again the.

Peter Wolf   38:23
Yeah.

Lem   38:26
The Google doc.
So this particular #2 is would consume pretty.
Heavy operation, yeah.

Peter Wolf   38:41
Large number, but again we got 10,000 right, so.

Lem   38:44
Yeah. So yeah, 10,000. And then if like it's just once per week, so it would be like also manageable if you would just postpany.

Peter Wolf   38:55
I really like how these dotted lines are showing you what it's doing as it's walking through.

Lem   39:00
Yeah, you could all.
We all could also like there's like a explain flow. If we click this explain flow it would also like see how the data is being processed.

Peter Wolf   39:05
Uh huh.
Huh. OK.

Lem   39:12
Yeah. So that's we could.

Nicholas Westburg   39:13
That's great.

Peter Wolf   39:14
We'll have to walk through that and get play around with that.

Lem   39:16
Yeah, it's like a walkthrough and then it won't consume operations, so that's good.
It would just like show how the data is being.

Peter Wolf   39:23
Yeah, 'cause especially 'cause. We got the variable things and all right, these are all variables.

Lem   39:27
Yeah. Yep, that's right. So.

Bryan Wolf   39:29
How do I turn it on?

Peter Wolf   39:32
What'd you say? How you trigger it?

Lem   39:33
Thank you.

Bryan Wolf   39:34
Does.

Lem   39:35
This one on the tree that's on the more and then just click the explain flow so it would.
It would appear that.

Peter Wolf   39:42
And what is what is export blueprint?
What is that?
Does that actually give you the whole diagram?

Bryan Wolf   39:47
Yeah, Dad, that's that's how we do.

Lem   39:47
Yeah, this is the one.
The yeah.

Peter Wolf   39:50
Oh, that's the Jason file.

Lem   39:50
This is how I yeah the Jason file.

Bryan Wolf   39:51
Yeah.

Lem   39:52
Yeah. Then the import one is how we import the particular Jason file here.

Peter Wolf   39:53
OK.
Yeah, other way. OK.

Lem   39:57
OK. And Yep. So now we could see the new newsletter flow.
We could go to the newsletter drop.
So here's the new one. I'll just add new here.
So the new one.
Is this one, so the updated?
I can see.
So this is the prompt prompt of the day.

Peter Wolf   40:25
Title, prompt, sanitation, so no link.

Lem   40:25
Yeah, this is a title.
And then the objective.

Peter Wolf   40:27
That's fine.
We can put something like if there is no link and just leave that out or something like that, right?

Lem   40:30
Yep.

Peter Wolf   40:33
We can put some kind of filtering.

Lem   40:36
Yeah, I think, yeah. But I think if we won't put a link here, I think ChatGPT won't add a link there also because actually test it out now. So so we've seen now that it's already updated this one.

Bryan Wolf   40:44
Yeah.

Lem   40:52
With.
Yeah. And then I'll just test it.
Wait, alright, I didn't add the yes.
So.
Ance.
So this would send the e-mail. Also it would create a e-mail campaign and then it will send a test e-mail to.
My e-mail.
For checking the formatting and also the content.
It's really slow right now.

Peter Wolf   42:29
All right.
So while we wait for this now, what I need to do is I need to figure out how we're gonna input.
We're gonna have another input.
It's gonna be stuff that's specific to serrala.
It's gonna be like the post of the week or post of the day blog post of the day. Something like that where we would include something that drives them to our website, right?

Lem   42:41
OK.

Peter Wolf   42:53
So it's gonna be at the very bottom.

Lem   42:54
Yep.

Peter Wolf   42:54
It would be the last. The last thing before.
Whatever kind of wrap up.

Lem   42:58
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   42:59
To another section and it would be serrala serrala Treasury services post of the day.

Lem   43:07
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   43:07
And and then we'll just again we could just put the link.
Into a spreadsheet, another tab, and then we can have Google Orchid BT do a summary of it.

Lem   43:14
OK.

Peter Wolf   43:18
Look at it.
Same thing it does with like the article. It will go out there and look at the site, see what the site contains and write something oriented without prompt.
To you know, a summary blurb that will be enticing to say, hey, here's new information about.
SAP, SAP, treasury.

Lem   43:44
OK.
So we would add that after conclusion, right?

Peter Wolf   43:47
Now before conclusion, after I would probably put it before prompt of the day or no leave prompt of the day and put it after prompt of the day.

Lem   43:48
Or here on the before conclusion, OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   43:55
It's the last thing that's really kind of driving them to our website.
Something for our website, it'll be.

Lem   44:00
OK.

Peter Wolf   44:01
It would be serrala treasury services.
Blog of the day or yeah blog post of the day.

Lem   44:08
Oh, OK.
Oh OK, blog post of the day. Then I will just find it on the serrala, right?

Peter Wolf   44:16
We would.
Let's let's add a spreadsheet and we'll just add the the URLs of the blogs we want, and then we'll just select which one's being included that day, right?
All we do is go to our Web C, find the, find the blogs, go into the spreadsheet, put the blog name and the the title and the URL in there. So we have tracking of it and we'll just put a list of 10 in.

Lem   44:37
OK.

Peter Wolf   44:37
So the next 10 newsletters would already have exactly what's going to be.
Incorporated. We decide what we're trying to prioritize.
We could always change or select which one we want, right?

Lem   44:45
Oh, OK, yeah.

Peter Wolf   44:47
So it doesn't have to go search, but we're gonna need another spreadsheet for it, I think.

Lem   44:51
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   44:52
Or maybe you could use one of the other ones.

Lem   44:53
I.

Peter Wolf   44:53
I'm not sure.

Lem   44:54
Yeah, we'll add another spreadsheet here for I think, yeah, before social media post because.

Peter Wolf   44:58
Yeah, let's let's add a new one and it would be again.

Lem   45:00
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   45:01
It would all be triggered by the end social media where we select and we say yes and it's going to grab every, every tab, whatever ones you have selected. That's what it's going to create into the newsletter.

Lem   45:05
Yeah, that's right.
Yep, Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   45:11
And so let's put it in. Let's put St.
SSTS blogging or something like that?

Lem   45:19
OK.
Sts.

Peter Wolf   45:22
As the title, STS being serrala Treasury services.

Bryan Wolf   45:25
There you go.

Lem   45:28
Right. OK.
Yeah. So this would be like.

Peter Wolf   45:30
Or you could maybe just change that. I'm sorry.

Lem   45:32
A.

Peter Wolf   45:34
STSSTS blog posts just like the social media posts.

Lem   45:38
Sts bug.
Then you would have like A blog title, right?

Bryan Wolf   45:44
Mute.

Peter Wolf   45:45
Yep, blog title and then the URL.

Lem   45:45
A blog title.
Yeah, the URL then.

Bryan Wolf   45:49
Yeah.

Lem   45:52
Like a summary, this is a summary of the content.

Peter Wolf   45:54
Yeah, but that would need to be a ChatGPT thing, right?
So I don't know if we're gonna run that first or how we get that.

Lem   46:04
Oh yeah.
If yeah, we would need another automation for.
This particular.
Yeah, we would need.
Because, yeah, this is actually already connect.
Yeah, it should be already populated here so.

Peter Wolf   46:23
Yeah, those are from the other flow.
This was the the input. There was already had already run through something and given the summary right, but here we wouldn't have that.

Lem   46:27
Yep.
Yep, yeah, yeah.
So we would have another one for.
Let's see.
The trigger would be like, well, we could actually add the trigger here to like like somewhere out.
Yeah, like summarize the blog post, yeah.

Peter Wolf   46:47
Oh, right, right here.
So if we add a new one, would you say click it and it goes and does a summary and it would just do that one mini flow?

Lem   46:53
Yep, that's right. Yeah.
Yeah, I will add Lear, let's say.

Peter Wolf   46:59
So interesting.
That would.
That flow would still go in the folder for this overall process, but it really wouldn't be hooked to anything else, right?

Lem   47:05
Yep.

Peter Wolf   47:07
It would just be hooked to this.

Lem   47:09
The yeah, that one.
Automation the new automation would be just hook like this one like grab summary.
Grab summary of the.
Link and then.

Peter Wolf   47:23
Can you make it say create summary, just 'cause. We're gonna send it the link and then?

Lem   47:26
Alright, great. Yeah.
Create summary.
From, let's say from the blog post from the blog post.
Link.
And then.
Yeah. We would just have.
Let's say this doesn't have the summary right.
We would have another like the same as this one.

Peter Wolf   47:50
Yep.

Lem   47:52
And then like a checklist. And then if we check that one, this particular would be this, the new automation would trigger and then it would populate the summary.

Peter Wolf   48:00
Yeah.

Lem   48:01
Here. Yeah, we could do that one.

Peter Wolf   48:02
OK, now in this flow I want to use the same thing as the writing flow for essentially the articles, right?
We're going to want it.
It's not going to well. What we what we want and this is where we got to refine that right now.

Lem   48:11
Uh.

Peter Wolf   48:16
I know we don't.
I think we just have my persona in there or something, but.
We want to make sure that that, that that write up is geared towards our readers towards our target market. And so ultimately I want to.

Lem   48:30
The.

Peter Wolf   48:32
Use a document in that prompt, just like we're doing on the other writings where we're writing the article summaries.
So really, if you take the article summaries flow and essentially copy that as what you want to trigger when this happens, right?

Lem   48:42
OK.

Peter Wolf   48:49
You're essentially gonna feed that blog in and tell it to look at that blog like it's looking at an article and write with the Persona and the document that's attached to write the summary in that kind of enticing way.
A.

Lem   49:02
Ah, yeah, yeah, that.
Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   49:05
So that way we should be able to largely copy the the the at least those steps for when we send the articles to to ChatGPT or to Claude or whatever.

Lem   49:06
I will just.
Add.
Umm.

Peter Wolf   49:14
It was a combination, I don't know.

Lem   49:15
Yep, yeah, it would be, I think, yeah on the.
It's coming from the here on.
The INA reader.
So you have here the like.
Title.
Extract title coming Barry.
Oh, this is just newsletter. Plus I think the other one. Yeah, but I think.

Peter Wolf   49:44
And when in that random can I ask you that random image generator?
Is there any parameter to it or is it totally random or is it a random but have a financial view or something like that?

Lem   49:52
Yeah, yeah, it it.
It has a parameter which is business, so we could have like financial services also here.
Yeah, but the the query here is business, so it would search a random photo on with the tag business.

Peter Wolf   50:02
OK.

Lem   50:11
But yeah, so that's the.

Peter Wolf   50:13
So I'm thinking if I if I like, I'm gonna pull up one of my websites for blogs.
Going on.

Lem   50:26
Yeah, this one.
Oh, this is just choosing the top three articles and the summary is actually on the.
Subsection for.
Title.
I think this one.
Hmm.
Oops.

Peter Wolf   51:48
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe I would change this to something.
Maybe not.
Blog of the day because let me just share what I have here.

Lem   51:58
OK.

Peter Wolf   51:59
So I can.
I might have a variety of different things we would include.
So.

Peter Wolf Jr   52:11
Why not call like expert talk or something?

Peter Wolf   52:13
Yeah. Or or or kind of resource of the day or something like here is this is a comprehensive guide for in House bank APMAPM Ihb.
It's not a blog, although it does have listed as authors, so I don't know. Maybe it would, could could.

Lem   52:26
OK.

Peter Wolf Jr   52:29
One you call daily insights.

Peter Wolf   52:32
I like that.
Yeah, right. Right. Serrala. Treasury services daily insights.

Peter Wolf Jr   52:38
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   52:39
That's good.
Because then if we have things like like this here, if we go to Estee Lauder case study. So here's.

Lem   52:40
Yeah.

Peter Wolf Jr   52:46
Right. Whether it's a whether it's just a quick snipper or process flow, it's it.
You can fit it all in there.

Peter Wolf   52:54
Yeah.
Yeah, but I'm trying to think of what we would do on kind of a header or something. I think Cha, cha BT at least would have to do some kind of strong header or the name of it plus something.
I just always feel like a visual is helpful, but not all of them are gonna have visuals, right?
I mean this does.

Lem   53:18
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   53:19
But.

Peter Wolf Jr   53:21
Open.

Peter Wolf   53:22
Like this other one that doesn't have any visual to incorporate.
Great.

Lem   53:27
Yeah. So we would.

Peter Wolf Jr   53:29
Use that Unsplash to make an AI visual.

Lem   53:32
How did this doesn't have?

Peter Wolf   53:33
Is that what that was?
That thing that's the Unsplash is there, 'cause. I keep getting emails from them.

Peter Wolf Jr   53:34
Is that what that was, I think.

Peter Wolf   53:37
Is that is that the tool we're using for making the?

Peter Wolf Jr   53:39
Is that the tool we're using for making the?
I don't know if it makes AI visuals.

Peter Wolf   53:42
Getting the feedback again.

Peter Wolf Jr   53:43
It might just pull free visuals off the Internet.

Lem   53:57
Image URL.

Peter Wolf   53:58
Oh, are you at the house, Peter? Yeah, you are.

Peter Wolf Jr   54:00
I'm leaving right now.

Peter Wolf   54:02
OK.

Peter Wolf Jr   54:08
Just ran up to get that air tag before Melody left.

Peter Wolf   54:12
OK.

Peter Wolf Jr   54:25
I have a question do you expect?
Section of this newsletter to have its own imaging.

Lem   54:32
Yep.

Peter Wolf Jr   54:35
Or just a handful of key image a key seconds.

Lem   54:35
No.

Peter Wolf   54:36
I.
I.
I mean, I gotta look after we pool it all together. Then I feel how overwhelming it is, right?
I mean, the thing with the with the superhuman is it's concise, it's tight. And right now we've got we've got headers, we've got images for each of the articles where they don't, right. They have one section and they have three articles and it's, you know, they've got a.
Little header there.
One image for that whole three articles, we've got a separate image for each.
I kind of like that.
But again, we'll have to run a few.
Tested this is see how it looks, how how it feels like as a consumer to determine whether we need to tighten it up.

Peter Wolf Jr   55:11
To determine whether we need to tighten it up, get rid of some things.

Peter Wolf   55:11
Get rid of some things.
Every now and then I get the feedback. Like right now I don't know what it is.

Peter Wolf Jr   55:16
Put down the light.

Peter Wolf   55:23
OK.
So I'll stop sharing.
Can we?
Do we get it?
Let's go look at what we got is our output from this most recent iteration.
You guys still there?

Lem   55:39
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   55:39
Yeah, I'm. I'm here.

Peter Wolf Jr   55:41
Yeah.

Lem   55:43
Can you?

Peter Wolf   55:43
Can we look at what the the latest iteration of output that we got?

Lem   55:50
Can you guys see my screen?

Peter Wolf   55:51
Right now, no, I I was sharing for a while, then I stopped.

Bryan Wolf   55:53
No.

Peter Wolf   55:55
So you have to re share.

Lem   55:59
Uh.
Pizza.
Share screen OK? Yeah. So the output for that would be this one.
So this is the newest 9:41 PM.

Peter Wolf   56:20
Yep. So just go down slowly.

Lem   56:21
So we have.

Peter Wolf   56:22
Please hold on.

Lem   56:23
The OK.

Peter Wolf   56:23
Welcome back today's insights, OK.
Scroll down.

Lem   56:29
These are the.

Peter Wolf   56:31
OK, surprise you. Literally the terrace. OK, keep going. AI, finance news.
All right.
OK.
Maybe we could make the images smaller?
They seem like they're taking up a lot of space.

Lem   56:49
Yeah, yeah, because I've iterated it as default so the like.
Scaling actually like because.

Peter Wolf   56:58
To the size of the, to the size of what we already have.

Lem   57:00
Yeah, yeah. But but yeah, because the last time, right, that this is not a uniform like the every table was like different sizes.

Peter Wolf   57:08
Yep, Yep.

Lem   57:10
So I added it to like.
Scale to the particular.

Peter Wolf   57:15
All right.
For right now, we'll leave.

Lem   57:17
Table.

Peter Wolf   57:17
We'll leave this and we'll figure it out.

Lem   57:18
Yep.
Yeah. So yeah, as you can see, this is much smaller than this one.
So they have like a box type of image, so that's why this has like a rectangle.

Peter Wolf   57:27
Yeah, so the image if the image is already wide then it won't be as tall because it's only gonna spread out to the width.

Lem   57:32
Yep.

Peter Wolf   57:33
But if it's not wide, then it's gonna get taller because it's got to spread out the same ratio for that height. OK.

Lem   57:34
Yep, that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah. So that's why it's.
And then yeah, this is this one social.

Peter Wolf   57:46
Social signals trending on social this week.
OK.

Lem   57:51
And then.
A.
Tools updates.

Peter Wolf   57:56
Yep.

Lem   57:58
Then this was the new prompt of the day.
Uh.
Then the conclusion, yeah.

Peter Wolf   58:04
OK. Can you do me a favor?
Do a control a, select all of that.

Lem   58:10
Control a.

Peter Wolf   58:14
On the screen.
Can you do it?
It should select there.

Lem   58:16
This one.

Peter Wolf   58:16
There you go.
And can you plug that into ChatGPT and ask it how many words there are?

Lem   58:23
OK.
Let me just 'cause it's adding also the.

Peter Wolf   58:27
That's fine.
I'm not looking for exact number, I'm just trying to get an idea.

Lem   58:32
We could actually check it to the like word counter.
I think this one's the.
1000 words.
1200 words.

Peter Wolf   58:43
Yeah. So can you go back over to ChatGPT and ask ChatGPT. How long does it take the normal reader to read 1200 words?
That's much longer than what the like the superhuman one is for sure. I think it's saying like 500, seven, 150 words.

Lem   59:09
Yes, like 6.6 to 5.3 minutes.

Peter Wolf   59:12
Oh, no, that's that's not bad. But I'm surprised because the other, the six minutes 'cause it was saying a 3 minute read.

Lem   59:15
Yep.

Peter Wolf   59:19
That's the way that the superhuman kind of approaches.

Lem   59:22
Hmm.

Peter Wolf   59:23
So they're doing like 750 words, I think, but that's good.

Lem   59:26
I see.

Peter Wolf   59:27
No, this is this is great.
They maybe we'll tighten it up.

Lem   59:29
Yeah, like half.

Peter Wolf   59:30
That's also reading the entire prompt and everything.
Again, we can maybe tighten up sections.
I like it though.
This is really this is looking really good.
But from my perspective, we're not doing it daily. If we were only doing it twice per week, then I think making it a little bit longer is also fine, right?

Lem   59:47
Yeah.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   59:53
I think it looks really terrific. I think the variety of the content we're putting in here again now we need to refine it.

Lem   59:55
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:00:00
We need to go and really look at what is the list of articles we're getting, how much quality are we getting? How many choices are we getting? The AI tools thing? I think we need to figure. Look at that.

Lem   1:00:05
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:00:10
I think we might alter that.
That might be the same thing where we do similar to the blog post.
For the Serral blog post that we may have a spreadsheet where we enter them in, we enter in the tools that we think are the interesting ones, and then we select which ones are included in.

Lem   1:00:26
Wow.

Peter Wolf   1:00:30
That we we can go out and really kind of search for very specific to our industry and what not.

Lem   1:00:34
Yep, we we could actually do it here on the AI tools and updates. You could actually like add it here and then like add the title of the particular tool.

Peter Wolf   1:00:38
Yeah.
And we can do the same thing as what we did on the on the search for the blog where we put another trigger that says write me a update or something a little log write up.

Lem   1:00:57
Yeah. Yeah, we could.

Peter Wolf   1:00:57
Well, that's really short.

Lem   1:00:58
Yeah. Yeah, we could do that.

Peter Wolf   1:01:00
We can just run that manually.
We could go find a tool, plug it in and say give me a give me a two sentence label on this.

Lem   1:01:08
Yeah, I I yeah, because I prompted this one to be short like A1 sentence because the output for this one was like this, right?

Peter Wolf   1:01:12
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:01:15
So it should be like short only.
But yeah, basically we could add here like if we add like like the one that we want.
So we yeah, we will just like click the button here and it it will take that one.
But for the like the summary, yeah, it we would have like the same as.
The STS blogs like create the create summary for yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:01:39
Yeah, let's let's do that.
Let's create it like the STS blogs but again with the prompt that you have for the other already, right?
Give me the one sent.
So they're uniform, so whatever the prompt is that you're using on that, that's the prompt you should call for that mini mini section, right?

Lem   1:01:49
Yeah. Yeah, that's right, yeah.
Like one sent.
Yep. Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:01:55
And then we could plug in a tool and then have it put a one. You know one liner on there.
I like that because then we can really manage this.
We could take the ones that are coming from the news feed and we could decide, OK.

Lem   1:02:08
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:02:08
Yeah, but we can pepper.
In some stuff that we see separately going on that might not be rising up on news, but we know it's very relevant to the team that we're working with, right.
I mean to the focus where we are.

Lem   1:02:20
Yep, that's right.
Ei tools.
Yeah, we would.
I would just add like something like this.
Here on the.
So that we would have.
A.
Choice also.
Like create.
A.
11 sentence summary.
Sentence summary.
For the.
AI pools.
Yeah, something like that.
And then when we click this one, it will. Let's say we add here a link.
Or.
Yeah. Let's see.
We add here a link and then it will take that link and then search that one and then put like a one line summary here and also title.

Peter Wolf   1:03:32
Yeah.

Lem   1:03:41
So yeah, I would add that one like 2 automations there for yeah also this one.

Peter Wolf   1:03:49
Awesome, I love it.

Lem   1:03:52
Sts blog post.
Yes. Yeah.
Post and also.
AI.
Yep, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:04:09
OK.

Lem   1:04:10
And then yeah, so for this one, it would be.
Like you would input the link here, right?
It will just be coming, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:04:19
Yep. And you would.

Lem   1:04:20
And then.

Peter Wolf   1:04:20
And then you would use the same. The same approach for the that you're using for the articles, right?

Lem   1:04:25
Yeah. For the summary of the articles, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:04:26
It's essentially you're assessing this like an article and saying what's interesting about it to our target market. So whatever that that prompt is and whatever the attached documents were including in that write up, that's exact same one we should use here.

Lem   1:04:32
Yep, that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah. So this was actually the one that's creating that one the like the summary for the article news.
So we I will just like copy this one like the get persona and then ChatGPT and then add that just tweak it a little bit for the serrala serrala blog post. But yeah that that would be the the new one there.

Peter Wolf   1:04:59
Perfect.

Lem   1:05:05
So Yep, I think that's that's it and.

Peter Wolf   1:05:08
I like it.
I really, really really like it. I feel like we're very close here.
And we put those couple component pieces in and then I really think I want to look at the articles and refine refine that.
The Eno reader search.

Lem   1:05:26
Yeah.
Yeah. For the yeah, for the inner reader, this actually.

Peter Wolf   1:05:29
And the the tools one, yeah.

Lem   1:05:36
We could actually update this, so I my inner in.
Yeah, my pro plan's already expired, but yeah, we could actually add here a filter like for example.

Peter Wolf   1:05:46
Yeah.

Lem   1:05:49
I added here a filter because this is actually like a finance right finance collection.

Peter Wolf   1:05:52
Yep, Yep.

Lem   1:05:53
So these are like all websites for finance. So I actually added.

Peter Wolf   1:05:56
Yep. And then you put AI.
Sit. It had to have AI in there.

Lem   1:05:59
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah. So we could actually.

Peter Wolf   1:06:01
Now I wonder is whole word AI?
Is it also looking for words like, you know, raid raid or something, or only when it says space and then AI in a space or only capitals?

Lem   1:06:14
Yeah, I think only AI we could also add, I think like artificial intelligence or yeah, something like that so.

Peter Wolf   1:06:19
Yeah. OK.
Yep.

Lem   1:06:23
Yeah, I think artificial intelligence would be.

Peter Wolf   1:06:24
And so right now, how many is this?
And Brian, I know yours is a copy of his.
I don't know how many articles are we pulling to go into the spreadsheet to choose from.

Lem   1:06:35
This one is.

Peter Wolf   1:06:35
Or go.
Actually, it's fooling them and going into ChatGPT, which is only then taking a handful, right?

Lem   1:06:40
Yeah. So we are pulling, yeah, for testing there. I've added only three, but the one the original one is actually pulling 30 here.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:41
Top three.

Lem   1:06:53
Let me just go back.
So I've actually edited this one.
So this one is actually already.
Yeah, I I mean I it's 20, but we could put it here because if.

Peter Wolf   1:07:01
OK.
Remind me, what's our limit on in a reader?
Are we paying for that application too, or is that a freebie or what?

Lem   1:07:10
We they have a free plan, but if the. Yeah. Yeah. The free plan doesn't have the the.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:11
It's free.
I'm on the free plan.
You're on the free plan too.

Peter Wolf   1:07:19
Filtering.

Lem   1:07:19
Like the filtering and also the create rule. So we we.

Peter Wolf   1:07:22
OK.
So we definitely have that.
So Brian, do you have that set up with the with the pay plan for me?

Lem   1:07:25
All, yeah, we.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:28
No, we both have the free plan.

Lem   1:07:30
Yeah. So but.

Peter Wolf   1:07:31
OK.
So we're gonna need to create the A paid plan.

Lem   1:07:34
Yeah, I think the yeah, the pricing of this one is I think just not too much.
It's not really expensive, but yeah, because we need here actually the filter and the create rule for the unread.
Because what will happen here if we we already have 100 unread?
It won't update this particular feed, so that's why I've added a rule that whenever.
A new.
Feed will come here. It will automatically put it as unread.
I mean read.
And then yeah, and also for the filter, it's also on the pro plan like the filter for let's say Treasury or artificial intelligence, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:08:15
Yeah. So we definitely need that.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:16
All right. So listen, you got a multi description option here for 999 or you can do 5999 for an annual subscription, the card user?

Lem   1:08:18
Yeah.
I think they have like monthly, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:08:28
Yeah, mostly 999, but this should.

Lem   1:08:29
Monthly plan.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:31
There's an description that's usually for 90, but they have a 30% discount for 5999.

Lem   1:08:33
Yeah.
Yeah.
So 999 per month.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:37
So.

Peter Wolf   1:08:39
So what's the difference?
What's the other one, Brian?
What are you saying, 1599? What's that?

Bryan Wolf   1:08:42
So there's there's one that's $5 per month and one that's $99.00 per month or $9.99 per month.
One is just an upfront payment.
So do you wanna pay an upfront payment to end up really paying 5 bucks a month? Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:08:55
Oh, you mean annual annual versus monthly?
No, just put it on monthly.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:59
The the annual is 30% off 5 bucks a month is what it's laid out to until June 24, 2026 or starting starting.

Peter Wolf   1:09:08
OK.
So that's 60 bucks for one shot pricing.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:12
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:09:13
OK, then that's let's do that.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:15
Alright.

Peter Wolf   1:09:17
Now I'm working with you separately to to do the credit card and then I'll put it on my and I don't want to do.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:21
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:09:24
I don't know if we this this whole thing.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:25
Let's talk.

Peter Wolf   1:09:26
Hold on this whole thing with login with Google.
I'm really frustrated with myself that I set so many accounts up with log in with Google Now and I can't change them, so anything we set up going forward where we can use my Google e-mail address, but it needs to be not log in with Google 'cause then.

Lem   1:09:40
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:44
What do you mean, Dad?

Peter Wolf   1:09:44
It's my Google password.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:45
I mean, yeah. OK, but.

Peter Wolf   1:09:46
Because if you go to them, you can now say if you're already logged in.
In on the browser in your Google and you say log in with Google and says, Oh yeah, you're the person who's already logged in with Google and just go right in.
But that means my Google password is tied directly to that, and that's just high risk. And especially right now because I'm letting you guys use this for different things and just puts me at high risk of my account. My Google account gets gets frickin hacked. I'm really in.
Trouble 'cause. I got so much **** tied to that.
I mean, they can immediately.
Go and try to go into financial stuff and approve that.
Move that through my Gmail and that's just bad.
Really bad.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:22
OK, OK, OK. OK.

Peter Wolf   1:10:23
So we we can't log to log in with Google.
It's it's e-mail setup, right? OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:28
I got you. I got you.
I got you.
It's just me I got.

Peter Wolf   1:10:31
Alright, I'm just still.
It just makes me nervous even on your PC.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:32
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:10:34
Yeah, I logged out of everything.

Peter Wolf   1:10:37
OK.
All right. So yeah, I think we are very close from my perspective.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:43
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:10:43
I asked my my marketing person to give me a header at least, a interim header.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:50
And they end up.

Peter Wolf   1:10:50
I mean the one that you have, it's fine.
That's one I have on my LinkedIn profile and but we're moving away from that. They call that a hero.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:58
Mm hmm.

Peter Wolf   1:10:58
Imagery. The guy sitting on the on the mountain.
So I need to get a new one there, but I think this is this looks really.

Lem   1:11:04
OK, this one.

Peter Wolf   1:11:08
Terrific. Yeah.

Lem   1:11:10
The.

Peter Wolf   1:11:15
Yeah, this really looks good. Again, I think there's some refinement.

Lem   1:11:15
Yeah. So yeah, we we need to refine the Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:11:18
I want to read the blurbs and see what they're looking like again.
We may switch from from chat, GBD to Claude for the wording, because I just see the performance of Claude being so much better than Cha Chi BT.

Lem   1:11:21
Yeah.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:11:33
But I'm gonna start looking through these and getting a flavor for this.
We should start. This should be producing everyday, right?
And what we should also do is, but I mean that means we need to go in and select to produce it.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:41
Right.

Lem   1:11:42
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:11:46
But.
I'm wondering I should always have somebody interact with it.

Lem   1:11:53
You mean the the scraping? It would be daily.
Or.

Peter Wolf   1:11:58
Yeah, I think it should, because that's going to give us more content and we can review what the blogs look like, what are the blurbs look like so we can assess how how good they are and then we get a bigger cachet when we say, OK, well, we.

Lem   1:12:00
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:12:11
Haven't run it in several days, but now when it comes to, let's say two times a week, I'm starting to think I'm going to do this two times a week.

Lem   1:12:17
Yeah, like the thing, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:12:18
Then I have.
I have.
You know the first three days or let's say I do it on Tuesdays and.
And Thursdays, Fridays, not good people are thinking about the weekends.
Mondays, hectic when they come in.
So I'm thinking Tuesdays and Thursdays, but then it only leaves a tight space for that second one. As far as new news, maybe I do do Tuesdays and Fridays or something.
Mondays is bad.
People come in.
They got it, especially in finance. They got, they got to focus.
So Tuesdays and Fridays, I would give it, you know, Saturday, Sunday, Monday for news. Then it would be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. For news to be included. And that way we'd have this running every day and it would be building up this cachet and we figure out what's going.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:55
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:13:03
To be included in the next newsletter so we get more choices.

Lem   1:13:06
Yeah. OK.
Yeah, yeah, we could set it up every day.

Peter Wolf   1:13:09
Right. So essentially each day we're getting the three best articles from that day. If it pulls 20 articles and gives us the three best and three days later, we should have nine good choices to choose from or four days later we should have, you know, 12 good Cho.

Lem   1:13:15
Yep.
Yep, Yep, that's right.
Yep, yeah, we we don't have problem actually on the inner reader side because yeah, this actually like updating very fast for as you can see this is already updated 4 minutes ago with like.

Peter Wolf   1:13:24
OK.

Lem   1:13:39
Ten. Yeah, just this R already have like more than 10.

Peter Wolf   1:13:45
You know, since we're not doing since we aren't doing and I guess we want to scan through and look what that what that it it hold on Eno readers giving a title and a little mini summary right it's giving chat gpda mini summary so I think.

Lem   1:13:45
Websites, yeah.
Pete. Yep.
Yeah, yeah, mini, sorry.
Yep, yeah, they have the minisummary already on their data. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:14:03
Yep, Yep.
So in my view.
I would be saying we would collect a lot more than that, right?
I know we're we're feeding that then to ChatGPT, which is taking tokens.

Lem   1:14:16
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:14:17
But if we're only feeding the summary and it's not really looking at the full article on those, that's going to be relatively small. I think we should be taking like a a much larger number of of blurbs to send, like, I don't know how many, what the volume.

Lem   1:14:25
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:14:34
Is we're getting in here to even choose from, but it seems like there's something like a couple 100.
I mean, grabbing 10 isn't really giving.
Us a wide variety.

Lem   1:14:41
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:14:41
I would say if we're seeing normally feeds that are coming up into that are available and it's 100 and something I'd be saying, let's grab 100 and feed them to ChatGPT and let ChatGPT figure out the best 3.

Lem   1:14:43
Yeah.
Like.

Peter Wolf   1:14:54
And each day we're getting the best three out of 100 articles, right?

Lem   1:14:57
Yep.
Yeah, we could actually do it.
Yeah, I added.
Only like 20 as limits here.
But yeah, we could actually like 30 or 50. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:15:04
Yep, I understand it, but I'm saying going forward, I think Bry will be set because again, we need to make sure this is working for me.
My accounts, my e-mail, my my spreadsheet and for me I want this to be coming out as let's go look at the Ino reader, see how many articles it's finding on kind of a daily basis.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:11
Full time. Yeah, it is. It is. It is, it is.

Lem   1:15:23
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:15:23
Right now it's just been building up for several days, right?
And we have only been, yeah, 865. Is that 865 articles.

Lem   1:15:27
Yeah.
This is also have for the at no I mean the AI collection. Yeah. So for the finance and economics, this is 328 these, but these are just.

Peter Wolf   1:15:32
AI filter.
Oh, that's just AI.
Yeah. Can you see how many of them? Yep.
Can you see how many have that filter where you said? If it was economics, finance, economics and AI, how many did you end up with that? Could you tell?

Lem   1:15:51
He no already because this already expired.
Plan so, but the filter I think.

Peter Wolf   1:15:56
Hello.

Lem   1:15:57
Yeah, it actually filtered out 159.
So it's yeah, matches 159 for the AI.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:04
Hey, Lynn. So I got a question for you.
So since these these triggers for the Peter's newsletter except for every 60 minutes, does that mean that he's gonna get a newsletter every 60 minutes in his e-mail?

Lem   1:16:07
Yep.
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:17
I feel like that's excessive, you know? Like I think we could turn this off.

Peter Wolf   1:16:18
It's not.
We're only triggering the newsletter when we go into the spreadsheet and we select the ones we want to include and we trigger that last step which says trigger.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:26
Alright, right.

Peter Wolf   1:16:27
But I don't think this should be running.
I don't think this should be running every 15 minutes.
To me this should run.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:32
It's 60 every 60 minutes, it says.

Lem   1:16:33
Yeah, just.

Peter Wolf   1:16:34
No, no, no.
I think this could run once per day once per day and it grabs 100 articles or even **** if there's if we I wanna find out of the 328 for example, how many actually had AI.

Lem   1:16:36
Just everyday.
Yeah, once per day, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:38
Yeah, well, that's what I'm trying to set up as once in the morning, yes.

Peter Wolf   1:16:48
In the title.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:49
Listen to me. I'm saying because on your account, should I turn this off after this call like you want to just keep it running all day.

Lem   1:16:50
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:16:55
No, I want you.
I want you to turn it on and I want it to be searching once per day to pull the articles right.
Remember, these are all separate little flows.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:03
OK.
Well, it's set for 60 minutes. So what do you want to do once every 24 hours?
Once every how many minutes is OK?

Peter Wolf   1:17:08
Yeah, once every 24 hours.

Lem   1:17:10
Yeah, we we have their like everyday like for the trigger.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:11
OK.
I don't know if we can even.
It says minutes though, so how many you know what?

Peter Wolf   1:17:16
Every day at 9:00 AM.

Lem   1:17:16
Yeah, the runs.

Peter Wolf   1:17:17
There you go.

Lem   1:17:18
Yeah. Yeah, we have every day there, 9:00 AM.

Peter Wolf   1:17:21
So then it's drawing all the news since yesterday.
And I wanted to.
I want to see the volume and I want to see with that filter that LEM has example of the AI.
It's an additional filter, not just finance and economics, but it's finance, economics and it has AI in the title.

Lem   1:17:38
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:17:38
I think you had it or should it maybe should say, oh, content yeah. Or content. Great, that's what.

Lem   1:17:40
Yeah, the title and content.
Title and content.
Yeah. And also let's see, we could also add another filter like artificial intelligence also.

Peter Wolf   1:17:50
Yeah. Yep.

Lem   1:17:51
So yeah, we could add as much filter.
So you I also have another fill filter here for remove duplicates, so this would remove the like duplicate articles and then you could add another filter.

Peter Wolf   1:18:03
Articles from when?
From the last time or when it's two different sources, but the same article or something OK?

Lem   1:18:07
Yeah, yeah, yes, that's right.
Maybe like it's coming from, like Yahoo News quoted.

Peter Wolf   1:18:11
Yeah, I've seen that obviously.

Lem   1:18:14
Yeah, something like that.
But yeah, we could actually add another filter like, let's say artificial intelligence also.
For the.

Peter Wolf   1:18:26
But then once you do this, you can't tell how many.
How many articles or was it giving you like a number?
I know you said your plan expired.
Hey, let if you you know if you want to switch to a monthly plan then I'll toss in the cost of that for us to while we're still working on this.

Lem   1:18:36
Yeah, it it's.

Peter Wolf   1:18:42
So you can have access to make sure we're continue to be efficient in this.

Lem   1:18:48
OK.
I mean I can also use actually your like inoreader.
I would just need the API key.

Peter Wolf   1:18:54
Yeah. OK.

Lem   1:18:56
So we just pay pay for one account.

Peter Wolf   1:18:57
Yeah. OK, good.

Lem   1:18:59
Yeah. Then I could just.

Peter Wolf   1:19:00
Yep. OK, good like it.

Lem   1:19:01
Yeah, use that one.
And yeah, basically we could actually find the filter here.
Yeah. So for for example this one has like 159 matches. So it just add.

Peter Wolf   1:19:14
Filter with the filter.

Lem   1:19:15
Yeah, this is with the filter, yeah.
So this is only for today, so it actually matched 159.
So it added it here to the unread.
So yeah, but yeah, because this is already like 231 I think.
Others here won't be adding, so that, for example, Yahoo Finance won't be adding like a new feed, but for others it's still not 100.
So it would be updating.
Per I think every hour.
Per R, So this one already updated.

Peter Wolf   1:19:46
Yes, I'm sorry I'm not.
I'm not fully understanding here.
So we have listed all these different.
Bead sources, right?
And again, we'll work through that and see if there's others we want to include and and what is the parameter right now.

Lem   1:19:54
Yeah, from the websites. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:20:01
It will keep. It will keep searching for those for those clusters or those kind of categories and then the filters and then when it reaches the filter only if it passes the filter will it add it to this list of unread or.

Lem   1:20:04
Yep.
Yes, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:20:17
So it has to pass the filter as well.

Lem   1:20:19
Yeah, it it has to pass through the filter and then if it has like artificial intelligence or like I think this is AIS.
Quite vague I think, because yeah, this is like two letter, but I think we should work artificial intelligence here or.

Peter Wolf   1:20:31
Yeah.
See, I think that probably is picking up any word with a combination of AI in it.

Lem   1:20:38
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, I think so also.
I mean, maybe that's why.

Peter Wolf   1:20:42
Can you do space AI space so that it has to have that where you put a Boolean in front of it like a dollar sign or a hash tag or something?

Lem   1:20:47
Uh.
I think this, yeah, it's a whole words, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:20:53
Yeah, whole word there. You're saying AI is a whole word.

Lem   1:20:56
So this action, but yeah, I don't have already the filter for this one.

Peter Wolf   1:20:59
Yeah.

Lem   1:20:59
But yeah, I think it this was a check mark a while ago, right?
So it's actually finding the aisle world.

Peter Wolf   1:21:06
OK, OK.

Lem   1:21:06
Cool word. Yeah. So I think that's that's working fine. But yeah, 159 matches.
So Yep, I think that would be.
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:21:19
And if we said to pull 200 and there were only 159, it would just feed us everything, right?

Lem   1:21:26
For the come again the.

Peter Wolf   1:21:29
If if we told it to pull 200 articles every day and there were only 159, it would, it would feed us everything that's available.

Lem   1:21:35
Yeah, it would.
Yeah, it would just feed the 159, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:21:38
Now, now from a from a.
A number of operations this could start to become a problem, right?
Because if I run this every single day and I pull 100 articles, let's just say 100 articles.

Lem   1:21:44
Yeah. Yeah, that's right it would.
Yeah, it would.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:21:53
So it's for sure gonna trigger the pulling of the article, then it's gonna feed every single article.

Lem   1:21:53
Select.
Yeah, it.

Peter Wolf   1:21:58
That means everyone is of those is in operation, then it's gonna feed them individually to ChatGPT right? And ChatGPT is gonna feedback 3:00. But that means 100 articles are drawn.
That's 100 triggers.
Then search for duplicates.
Is that 100 triggers as well?

Lem   1:22:16
Yeah, this would be 100 also. So it would search for duplicates like 1-2 and then it would create UUID for like 100 because we are actually putting all that articles on the All Articles spreadsheet. So that would.

Peter Wolf   1:22:20
Oh goodness.
Wow. Wow.
And what happens when I exceed 10,000 operations?

Lem   1:22:37
You would need to buy again like.
Operations. So you could.

Peter Wolf   1:22:43
How much do they charge?

Lem   1:22:46
I think depending on the plan because they have like the the different different I think.
$20.00 for 10K operations for the for plan, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:22:59
$20 per 10K OK. And if I'm doing again, if we think about this, that potentially could be 1000, if I did a hundred articles, you could potentially have 1000 operations in that one run per day.

Lem   1:23:07
Yeah.
Oh yeah, that's right.
Yeah, in that one run. Yeah. Per day.
So that would really, yeah, cost a lot.

Peter Wolf   1:23:13
Wow.
Wow.

Lem   1:23:18
So.

Peter Wolf   1:23:19
I need to think about that.
It may be.
It may be that we should change the order of the operations and we should take them and feed them immediately to Chachi, BT and say.
Only pick the three. That way you do 100 for the get 100 to the feed the cha Cha BT but after that it would only be three articles.

Lem   1:23:41
Yeah, we could actually like bypass this.
All of we we don't need to put it all on the all articles.
So like we would remove this one because yeah. And then.

Peter Wolf   1:23:49
Yeah.

Lem   1:23:55
We would just check the duplicates here on the filtered articles and then the.

Peter Wolf   1:24:00
But I would say even check the duplicate after the after we do the three.

Lem   1:24:03
All.

Peter Wolf   1:24:06
'Cause you know the first of all, we've said we only gonna filter, unread, you know. Is it possible that same article comes up on another site a couple days later? Absolutely. Right.

Lem   1:24:07
Yeah. Yeah, that's right, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:24:14
Is it likely that it's one of the three that we select out of the 100 every day?

Lem   1:24:15
Yep, Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:24:19
Probably less likely, but possible. If it was a good one.

Lem   1:24:22
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:24:23
But then the worst case is that it turns out to be a duplicate and we end up with only two articles that day because it says it's duplicate. But.
We avoid doing a whole 100 every time to the main spreadsheet and we avoid the feeding.

Lem   1:24:37
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:24:40
Yeah, we we just avoid several steps where we create the UUID, which is another 100, right?

Lem   1:24:42
Yeah.
Yeah, basically it would be something like this one.
So you would remove all of this.
For the.
Because, yeah, this would if.
Let's say we're like getting 101 hundred articles.
So it would actually like 123456. This one doesn't have, so I think only 5.

Peter Wolf   1:25:05
Yeah.
Six times.

Lem   1:25:12
So this. Yeah, six times.

Peter Wolf   1:25:12
100.

Lem   1:25:14
100 so already 600. So I think we could bypass that one and then just connect this here. So it will get all the articles and then?

Peter Wolf   1:25:15
Yeah.

Lem   1:25:22
Like feed it directly to like ChatGPT.
So let's say we would add the aggregator here.
So put it all in one bundle and then feed that bundle to ChatGPT so it would feed that chat with GPT, so we would only have like 100 and then this is only one because this is already aggregated so.

Peter Wolf   1:25:35
Yep.
Yep.

Lem   1:25:44
I mean no.

Peter Wolf   1:25:44
And then we put we have to put the random generator back in there for the three, right?
The switch of empty and the random generator random image generator.
But now it would only be for three instead of 100.

Lem   1:25:55
Yeah.
Yeah. Now we could.
Actually, we could just add this one on the next steps.

Peter Wolf   1:26:03
Yeah.

Lem   1:26:04
So basically what will happen here?

Peter Wolf   1:26:06
That's what I'm saying.
Add it back between top.
Choose top three articles in the iterator or something in there. After it chooses the top three.
So we're not doing it 100 times, but only three times.

Lem   1:26:18
Yeah, yeah.
So basically this would only cost 2 operations. If it's like this because let's say yeah this has like 100 bundles, right?

Peter Wolf   1:26:23
Oh really?

Lem   1:26:27
It would put all of that bundle here onto 11.

Peter Wolf   1:26:28
Yeah.
One massive feed, so one operation.

Lem   1:26:34
Text, yeah.
So this should be, yeah.
So the only thing here is maybe ChatGPT would like time out because that would be even like we put here like a 20,000.

Peter Wolf   1:26:45
But it's only, but it's it's 100 * 50.
It's only 5000 words.
I mean, if we said that the blurb that's coming from the inner readers less than 50 characters.

Lem   1:26:52
Yeah, I think.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think it.
Yeah, it can still process that one.
And then, yeah, basically, yeah. But this would like, yeah, be much cheaper.

Peter Wolf   1:26:58
Should be able to.

Lem   1:27:04
So it would, yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:27:05
Oh, let's absolutely do that for sure.

Lem   1:27:07
So one, yeah, it would just be 1 bundle out one operation here and then with several bundles and then it would.
Aggregate it all to the one massive 1 massive structure with like this.

Peter Wolf   1:27:21
Yep.

Lem   1:27:22
And then now we could feed it to ChatGPT, so it would just be 1 bundle.

Peter Wolf   1:27:26
Yep, awesome.
And then what comes out is 3 individuals, and at that point, even if you're running multiple steps on those, it's only three.

Lem   1:27:27
So yeah.
Yep, that's right. It would, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:27:33
That's much better, right?

Lem   1:27:34
Yeah, it's only three.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:27:35
We need to be thinking about those kinds of things.
I mean, obviously we started the process just trying to make the process work and and get our arms around it. But as we start to refine it, then we need to be thinking about these things because when it starts to be that we could be creating a th.

Lem   1:27:38
Yep.
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:27:49
Or 2000 operations per day.

Lem   1:27:51
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:27:53
Then it could really add up fast.
Right.

Lem   1:27:55
Yeah. Yeah, that's right, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:27:57
But this is a much more efficient way.
I like that.
So we need to pop back in the the random image generator if it doesn't have an image and all that, but it'll be after when we get down to three articles. Yeah, perfect. Great.

Lem   1:28:03
Yeah, here.
Yeah, it's after so.

Peter Wolf   1:28:07
So let's make that change.

Lem   1:28:09
It.
Yeah, it to be here. OK.

Peter Wolf   1:28:13
Yeah. OK.
So guys, I'm gonna drop off. You still got 1/2 an hour, so I don't know if you want to walk through more the details again from my perspective, I think Bry, this is all you guys. This is starting to really become a pretty cool flow and I.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:30
I agree.

Peter Wolf   1:28:31
Think you really need to be getting into understanding what the steps are.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:31
I agree.

Nicholas Westburg   1:28:32
Definitely.

Peter Wolf   1:28:35
Why we separated them out?
How do we troubleshoot it?
What happens if this occurs?
What happens if that occurs?
Really, to get your arms around it because again.

Lem   1:28:42
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:28:44
If ultimately you put this on your GitHub and, well, no, I know.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:47
This isn't done yet, though, is it? This is not.
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:28:50
No, no, it's not done yet.
But you really need to start getting used to it, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:28:52
I already AM.

Peter Wolf   1:28:53
And we're still OK.

Lem   1:28:54
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:28:55
I'm not ********.
I'm giving you guidance here in turn #1OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:56
Yeah. OK. All right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:29:00
Stop it before you get your hands, Mack.
So.
I think this is great stuff to just be drilling into and because you're ultimately gonna need to walk people through this, you're gonna need to be explaining.
How and why we have all these different flows of these different points?
What are they triggering?
You need to understand all the individual steps, what they mean, what they do.
Yeah. So I mean, I would just be drilling into this thing and looking at what are the triggers, what are the calls, what are the add insurance, what's the controls, all those kinds of things.
But I think we're very close.

Lem   1:29:35
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:29:37
Again, I want to work on the INNO reader. I want to see about further refining if we go look through those 300 and some articles for example and and get a sense, are we really coming up with stuff that's pretty decent or do we need to ref?

Lem   1:29:42
OK.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:29:52
It further and find more specific stuff that's very tailored to to our market. I mean, I really want to find interesting high quality.

Lem   1:30:00
Yeah, we could.
Also, actually we could actually add here like websites with particular if you have like you're following one website. Yeah we could actually add it to this folder. Yeah. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:30:03
Feeds, yeah.
Yep, Yep.
Yep.
And there there are a bunch that I that I do have that put articles out now.
Most of those are. Some of those are pay to play where other people are paying to get their articles on there. So we'll have to figure out what we want.

Lem   1:30:22
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:30:23
But I think the curating of that list right there that you have is going to be important, right?

Lem   1:30:26
Yep.
Yeah, this is, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:30:29
Personal finance. That's not gonna be relevant.
I think the Economist.

Lem   1:30:34
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:30:34
There's others, but we'll go figure that out. And I think that'll be much more tailored towards what we specifically want.

Lem   1:30:36
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:30:40
So Brian, you and I need to work on that.

Lem   1:30:41
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:30:43
So if you make a note off to the side, we'll do some some searching. Then we also need to search on on LinkedIn accounts that are going to be good topics on.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:44
Yeah.

Lem   1:30:44
Yeah, we.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:54
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:30:55
On Reddit accounts that are going to be good topics or submit subreddits.

Lem   1:30:57
Umm.

Peter Wolf   1:30:59
Right. Because we right now, we said we have say again.

Lem   1:30:59
Yeah, for yeah, this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:00
Vicky, help me.

Lem   1:31:04
That's right for the scraping. Yeah, that's yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:04
I just.

Peter Wolf   1:31:07
Yeah, right.

Lem   1:31:08
And also for yeah, for this one you need also to.

Peter Wolf   1:31:08
So we need to go.

Lem   1:31:13
Register to Apify, so it's just apify.
I think I have.

Peter Wolf   1:31:19
And so Brian, we need to be capturing all these in a spreadsheet.
What are all these apps that we're applying to?

Lem   1:31:23
Amplify.

Peter Wolf   1:31:24
I put them in my own spreadsheet, but we need a separate one that's being identifying per really per flow. What are the different apps that we have?

Bryan Wolf   1:31:32
Mm hmm.

Peter Wolf   1:31:33
So we know in the newsletter feed we need Eno reader 'cause if I hand this off to other teams, they're gonna need to set these up, or my company's gonna need to set them up at a company level.

Lem   1:31:34
Yep.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:31:43
So you need either a reader.
You need that appfi.
You need the scraper.
You need the LinkedIn.
You need a read it.
Need this and that we need to per per flow we should have a spreadsheet.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:49
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:31:52
What are all the interfaces AP is or connectors and accounts that we have to have?
So let's start that now and store that.

Lem   1:31:58
Yeah, I.
For this one also, let's say we've already like finished the final version. I could like build documentation for this one so that it would be easy to yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:32:06
Yeah.
OK.
I don't feel like we're quite finished yet.
We're getting very close, so you could certainly start building a documentation, at least on all the apps and AP is and everything that we're including, right building up a a repository of that.

Lem   1:32:14
OK. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll just, yeah.
Yeah, put it on like a Google doc. And then, yeah, also like the air refill.

Peter Wolf   1:32:28
But I think if you do those couple things that we talked about with adding the blog, then I think we need to figure something out on the formatting of the prompt.
I want the prompt to look really sharp and so we're going to have to figure out some way that we get the prompt in the format that we want.

Lem   1:32:40
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:32:46
I don't know if it's then we put it in the spreadsheet and the spreadsheet then creates ChatGPT with appropriate formatting and creates a doc and then the document is grabbed with its formatting to fill that in.

Lem   1:32:56
Oh, it's fun.

Peter Wolf   1:32:56
But I wanted to be.
Like even that I can see it, but it looks.

Lem   1:32:58
Hmm.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:33:01
It looks.
It looks too confusing.
It needs spacing between the paragraphs and the bullets and all that kind of stuff. I really wanted to be immediately scanable and when it's all clustered together like that, it feels overwhelming.

Lem   1:33:05
Yeah, just in spacing there.
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:33:14
And people are just gonna be like, yeah, I'm not.
I'm not reading this right, but if you can easily see identify top three currency pairs and summarize exchange rate movements. I mean, that's stuff that will stand out if it were spread out a little bit better.

Lem   1:33:17
Yeah, yeah.
Yep, that's right. I think it's.

Peter Wolf   1:33:28
But I do like this. The rendition of the white on black is it essentially looks like you're typing it into one of the, you know, GPD.

Lem   1:33:33
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:33:35
So I think that's great and the fact that you can click on it and then extract the the actual text, I think that's great as well because I was trying to figure out how we could, you know, make it easy and it's not just an image for them.

Lem   1:33:43
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:33:48
To paste in, but they can actually get the text, so I think this is looking terrific.

Lem   1:33:50
Yeah, this is a text.

Peter Wolf   1:33:53
Again, some small refinements, but man, I I think we're damn ready.
Damn close to popping this out and I think doing a little bit of additional searching to find some AI tools that are worthwhile coming up with some prompts and figuring out how we do the structuring appropriately and then refining with the LinkedIn and the Reddit accounts and is.

Lem   1:34:00
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:34:16
There any other social media?
I mean, X is really the the other one, right?
I mean, LinkedIn is good because that's where business people are largely looking.

Lem   1:34:20
Yeah, I'm.

Peter Wolf   1:34:25
And maybe LinkedIn and Reddit is fine.
And I don't know. Nick, do you have some Reddit subreddits that you could research that would find, you know, very specifically kind of finance and AI, not personal finance, but kind of corporate finance and AI or AI technology?

Nicholas Westburg   1:34:40
Definitely I'm a.
I'm a part of a a bunch of them so I can get them into the excel that we're working on or send them over to you or Lam or whatever works best.

Peter Wolf   1:34:49
Yeah, no shell.
I mean you can send them to to Bry bry's going to be building the core one for me again.
I'm I'm being selfish here.
I need this for myself, for the company, but we can send them out as a kind of put them into a spreadsheet that we all have access to on that shared drive and you guys can have them in your individual ones or if you're focused on something differe.

Nicholas Westburg   1:34:59
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:35:10
If you want to create a personal newsletter, I mean I I see this as opportunity to even do that.
For you guys individually.
Seems maybe you know.
I don't know.
Maybe it seems like that's kinda weird. I'm doing my personal newsletter, but hey, what the hell? Why not right?

Nicholas Westburg   1:35:25
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:35:25
And you can put that on your LinkedIn and whatever.
I just think there's a lot of opportunity here at both individual and at at corporate level.
So I'm certainly thinking about that exact same thing to my myself to be honest with you.
But I think there probably way too much overlap between what I'm doing corporate wise and what I do personally.
But I think it's something worth considering.
But if you could if you could.

Nicholas Westburg   1:35:47
Absolutely.

Peter Wolf   1:35:49
Pool together.
Some some topics.
I mean some some reddits that you think would contain potentially strings commentary that that would be, you know that might work well into including in here?
That would be great.

Nicholas Westburg   1:36:05
Yeah, definitely.
And back to what you said too.
So you do.
There's a few other options, so you hit on most of them right?
LinkedIn, Reddit X.
I.
There's a lot of places where some of these top guys have content.
And there's a wealth of knowledge.
Two other ones that I found are also medium, which I really really like.

Lem   1:36:28
All right, medium, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:36:29
Medium and then.
Sub stack I'm not.
I used to be on sub stack.
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:36:36
Can we get does medium have API to to look at or what?

Nicholas Westburg   1:36:41
That's a great quote.
Oh yeah, medium scraper.

Lem   1:36:44
We think they, yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:36:44
Yeah, there's definitely a way to scrape medium for sure.

Lem   1:36:47
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:36:47
And there's a wealth, wealth, wealth of knowledge on there.

Lem   1:36:53
Yeah, I think.

Peter Wolf   1:36:54
Yeah. So I would then say let's, let's take a look at medium and see what kind of stuff we find there, whether that's also, I don't know what kind of filtering it has, but and what was the other one you were calling out.

Lem   1:37:06
Yeah, it.

Nicholas Westburg   1:37:08
Sub stack.

Peter Wolf   1:37:10
Substack.

Nicholas Westburg   1:37:12
And it's good because you can really, you know, some of the contents could you know you can base it off, you know, intuition and and doing the search and reviews and whatnot.
But there's a wealth of niche knowledge, right?
Not just focused solely on one thing.
Same as medium, right? Because.

Peter Wolf   1:37:28
Oh yeah, no, I've seen this one before.
I I I played around with this but it must've been more than six months ago, this medium one.
So this is yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:37:37
Medium's wonderful.

Peter Wolf   1:37:39
Isn't this like people curating their own personal kind of again kind of conversation strings or their their message boards like like Reddit?

Nicholas Westburg   1:37:50
They're not.
No, no. Yeah, not message board.
Not like Reddit, but it's, you know, it's use, whether it's them posting tutorials or personal blogs or step by steps or you know they could be working in finance and they're, you know, they've noticed this and they read an article on it or they're referencing other sources that.
They read or talking about a research paper that they read and curating their own.
Post.

Peter Wolf   1:38:21
OK.
All right. So maybe we'll take.
I I would say let's take a look at content there and see do we think that we're gonna find ones that are gonna fit into the mold that we're looking for and then looks like from a API looks like they got enough stuff, right that you can SC.
With it keywords or something.

Lem   1:38:41
Yeah, we could actually, I think.
Yeah, this would have the keyword.
Like let's say Ain.

Peter Wolf   1:38:48
And can you do bullying?

Nicholas Westburg   1:38:49
Medium stands out too.

Peter Wolf   1:38:50
Can you do?
And yeah, that's what I'm saying.
And yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:38:53
Medium really stands out with their articles that users post for me personally, because they the way that mediums rant when people see a medium post, it's just like like I said, me personally it just stands out.
It's a big bold header and then when you click on it, it's just like boom right in front of your face.

Lem   1:39:09
$10 per month.

Nicholas Westburg   1:39:11
And it's not just a bunch of words all over the place, like everything's formatted, it's it's readable.
You you follow whatever you want to follow and it yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:39:25
You know, I'm thinking also on the on the where I said we would do the blog of the day or inside of the day.
I think we need another section and this is where we're really gonna have to figure out how much of this really makes sense and we tighten things down.
But I'm gonna need something like upcoming events because we have some webinar series coming up and I'm definitely gonna want to promote those.
So I'm gonna need another section.

Lem   1:39:54
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:39:56
It's gonna be upcoming events and.

Lem   1:39:58
Upcoming events.

Peter Wolf   1:40:00
And with that, there's like a landing page, so it would be kinda like the URL, but it's not we we can't write the blog like it's an article because there won't be really an article. It's going to be a typically it's gonna be a webinar.
Yeah, I have to figure out how we do that. So for at least the next two months.

Nicholas Westburg   1:40:19
Backlinks. So backlinks, backlinks to those events kind of just talking about like you know.
The event, just like a typical newsletter.

Peter Wolf   1:40:33
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:40:34
The event URLI guess.

Peter Wolf   1:40:36
Yeah, and the event URL is going to be it's. I think they had finalized it that this shows all three of the series coming up and it shows the dates for each of them.
It gives a shows who's speaking at them and all that kind of stuff.
So I think I'm definitely going to need that.
I'm going to need another section that's going to be.
It's going to be upcoming STS upcoming events and then we'll figure out how we craft the the the prompt to give it the wording to include.
Along with that.

Nicholas Westburg   1:41:07
Yeah, I actually just did one of those for for work.
Like 5 months ago for like tech events or whatever, I helped helped my team do that.

Peter Wolf   1:41:21
All right.

Nicholas Westburg   1:41:21
I didn't really do anything, but I have it just for like reference to see how we did it.

Peter Wolf   1:41:27
All right, so I need to drop off. But you guys, if you can, whoever can stay on, I would say and work through additionally, what other items we have, Brian, definitely I want to get this up and working on my e-mail for and my drive to to have.
The spreadsheet where all this stuff is being managed on my drive.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:48
What do you mean?

Peter Wolf   1:41:49
So I can get to it.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:49
Hold on. It's already up and running, I understand.
So this isn't even done yet.

Peter Wolf   1:41:52
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:53
This this is flows and done yet everything on your Google Sheets is running your research thing, your newsletter thing. It's all running.

Peter Wolf   1:41:58
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:00
So I don't know what else you want me to to to work on with this because this isn't done.

Peter Wolf   1:42:01
OK so.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:03
We gotta wait till tomorrow when he finishes up, and then you know.

Peter Wolf   1:42:07
OK.
So.
Hold on a second.
OK.
Right. So you're saying this this isn't done. So we don't have any of this built into our environment.
This is still Lem working on the baseline and you.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:28
Whatever one he just showed.

Lem   1:42:29
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:42:30
Haven't. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:31
So the one he just showed, it's like step two or three of the newsletter he just built out more of the one we already have.

Peter Wolf   1:42:40
Yeah. OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:40
I believe so.
Right, love.

Lem   1:42:41
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:43
Yeah.

Lem   1:42:43
Actually I've iterated the ones that I've because I've sent you guys like the first iteration of the newsletter process flow.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:51
Yeah.

Lem   1:42:52
But now there's like some additional steps, but actually that is also running.
So you could you guys could, like play around with that one.
But yeah, it would be different from.
The output would be not the same as this one because.

Peter Wolf   1:43:06
And I guess here's here's A and I want to find an effective way.

Lem   1:43:07
Yeah, but I I can send you, but I can.
Yeah, I can also send you guys this Jason blueprints now.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:14
The Jason. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. If you want to send me the Jason, that'd be great.

Lem   1:43:15
Yeah. The the new ones.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:18
That way I can play around for today and then whatever you whatever you finish and and we we get to like a final product or a better product then we'll just take the Jason out of that one and get there.

Lem   1:43:20
Yeah. OK.
I will send it.
Yeah, I'll just send again the new one.

Peter Wolf   1:43:28
Yeah, 'cause, I think when we're doing new flows then adding a Jason that has a new flow in the same folder, but it not really connected, that's easy for you to add a new one. But if you were making tweaks to other flows, then I think it's a.
Little bit harder, right?
Because if you send a new Jason, it's going to overwrite everything that was already there.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:48
Well, no. I would just create a new scenario.
Put the Jason in there and then if I got that one to the point where I where I would just delete the old one or move it to a different folder and put the new one in there instead of rewriting over the whole thing or you know if.

Lem   1:44:03
That's right, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:05
Lem got to the point where he he completed all of it and we had everything we needed.
I would just write over the old one.

Peter Wolf   1:44:12
Right. But you just gotta realize, guys, this is as much as we might want to believe.

Lem   1:44:12
Yeah, just export again new one.

Peter Wolf   1:44:17
We gotta finalize product.
There's gonna be tweaking for this.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:20
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:44:20
I would say continuously once we get rolling, it's like OK no fix this tweak that at that point. You know if Lem's making the changes we need to be very clear on what those are and then just figuring those changes and kind of in a very is.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:23
Right, right, right.
Yes.

Peter Wolf   1:44:35
Way, right?
You know very specific way, making those tweaks to it.
As opposed to trying to import all thing where you have to reset your connection.
And all those kinds of other things, right, so.
All right.
Yeah, and I prefer it this way. Like this alternative is we my account becomes the account that Lem uses for building this stuff and has all my connections and everything's done directly in there.
But I think it's good from AI. Think it's good from perspective for you guys for learning.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:58
Well, that would be great.
Well, I like to learn 'cause. I really am just doing everything twice or three times, you know, so I don't want.

Peter Wolf   1:45:03
I mean, I mean.
Yeah, I think that's valuable.
I think that's valuable.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:09
Yeah, I think it is too.

Peter Wolf   1:45:10
I mean, not all the. Yeah. OK.
So then I need you guys to coordinate on what's the most efficient way when you're doing these different tweaks to make sure you're getting them over there.
But we need to be building it along the way. And yeah, and and refining. And then as I said, my intention is to take these then and move them into Microsoft Environment.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:33
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:45:34
Not an outside make environment, and that's gonna be kind of another.
Iteration, right?
That it's gonna be a little different, but we should use the same steps.

Lem   1:45:40
Yeah, I'm not afraid.

Peter Wolf   1:45:42
But how does it work in the Ms. environment?
And what are the connections and all those kinds of things? All the APIs.
So that's gonna be a whole nother set of work that will again hopefully reinforce the process flow and think about it in terms of process rather than in terms of technology.
But technology is important, right?
You guys are learning different environments to be able to build these process flows in one of the nuances of those.

Lem   1:46:01
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:46:07
Different environments.
But I think this really I am really, really pleased with this and I think it is awesome content.
I think it's starting to look very sharp, very professional. If we really refine right now.
Those again the accounts that we're pulling for the social media and and the the feed for the articles. If we get that down to really the best of the best then this thing is I think going to be terrific.

Lem   1:46:36
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:46:36
So good progress. Appreciate it.
If you guys can plow, plow forward on kind of making those tweaks we talked about and and then yeah, we'll connect tomorrow, OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:43
Yeah.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:46:48
All right.
Thanks guys.

Lem   1:46:49
Either no problem.

Peter Wolf   1:46:50
Talk to you later.

Nicholas Westburg   1:46:51
Bye.

Lem   1:46:52
OK, talk to you soon.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:54
Alright, listen.

Lem   1:46:55
OK.
Hey, Brian.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:56
Do you have another call at 11 today?

Lem   1:47:00
For 11.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:01
Honestly, it's. Listen. Listen. So I I don't really.

Lem   1:47:03
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:05
He frustrates me, 'cause. He's talking about his tweaks.
There's no tweaks to make, So what I want to do is if so, I can fart around with what's going on today with the. I know you're gonna have to make changes by tomorrow or two days from now.

Lem   1:47:17
Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   1:47:18
Alright guys, I gotta run. See ya.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:18
So it's just gonna be. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So it's just gonna be pointless, but just just to keep him in mind. Keep Peter at ease.

Lem   1:47:21
OK, nick.
Bye bye.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:26
Can you send me over the Jason file that you have for this? And then?

Lem   1:47:29
Yeah, the updated ones, OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:31
Yeah. And then I'll just go over what we went over today with in the recording and and whatever work on it.

Lem   1:47:37
Yeah.
Yep, OK.
No problem.
Just double check the web hooks for the like the Google App script right I I already.
Told you the because I think, yeah, you would need to like reconnect the this hooks on the spreadsheet.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:49
Yeah.
Extension on the bushes.
Yeah. Hey, can you share the blue sheets with me too?

Lem   1:47:59
Yeah, and yeah, I'll. I'll also send the Google sheet with share link and just duplicate that one.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:02
Or yeah.
Yeah, and I'll just.
I'll just make a copy. I'm gonna make a copy.

Lem   1:48:08
Yeah. Yeah, that's right, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:08
So I'm not in your actual all right?

Lem   1:48:11
Just duplicate that one so that, yeah, I think the Google script also would be duplicated if you duplicate the spreadsheet. So that would be easier to like, copy paste the web books for you.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:22
OK, cool. Awesome, awesome.

Lem   1:48:22
On there. OK. Yep, no problem.

Bryan Wolf   1:48:24
