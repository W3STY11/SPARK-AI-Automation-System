Bryan Wolf   0:05
Want a smoothie? Sure.
OK.
What's going on? What's going on then?

Lem   1:48
Hello guys.
So morning. Yeah, all good.

Bryan Wolf   1:54
Morning for me, night for you.

Lem   1:57
Yep. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:58
You know, how's it going?

Lem   2:02
Yeah, all good. Just a little busy, but yeah, all good.

Bryan Wolf   2:07
Little busy day on a busy day.

Lem   2:09
Yeah, from other clients, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   2:11
That's all right. I'm about to have a busy day too, so I feel your pain, you know?

Lem   2:16
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   2:18
So I see you sent these looms. Are these just you walking through? I didn't get a chance to lift them. Are these just you walking through the flows, the flows that you were saying?

Lem   2:25
Yeah, the yeah, the flows like one by one. Just a rough overview because for Nick, he was I I yeah, I just sent you the copy. Maybe you could also check it from.

Bryan Wolf   2:32
So.
Yes. Oh, right. He's asking.
For sure, I'm gonna watch over them definitely. But I know yesterday for Pete, so we were going through the the newsletter and the company research one and I think we just want to kind of hone in on like more key data points like for that we're pulling.

Lem   2:41
If you have, yeah.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   3:00
From almost like for the newsletter like it kind of just seems like we're it's just cause I know reader we're pulling from a really vast article pool and they don't really have like you know a a shorter net which much more direct you know information and facts that we're looking for and I just think that's that's.

Lem   3:10
OK.

Peter Wolf   3:14
Sure.

Lem   3:19
OK.

Bryan Wolf   3:20
Probably because of the articles that we're choosing or the news outs are picking. But I know Peter was saying that there was some way that we can almost directly pinpoint specific topics and articles that we want to choose from from my no reader. And then I think we're also gonna wanna do the same thing with the with the with the.

Peter Wolf   3:32
Yeah, well, that was that was based on Lem's input, right?

Lem   3:33
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   3:37
Yeah, yeah. And I think we'll do the same thing with the with the company research, almost like we're just looking for some more certain direct, you know, facts, statistics and information about whatever company we're looking for instead of just, you know, a broad chat to BTO review. So I think, I think we kind of need just.

Lem   3:38
Yeah, the filter. Yeah, we could.

Peter Wolf   3:51
Yeah, because what we got back in those last few and I did a couple things and I'm, I'm not sure what you guys were already talking about, but a couple things. One is the the job search is working and it's going and populating the spreadsheet.
But it's populating with jobs that aren't the jobs we're looking for. They're generic SAP jobs. So we have to, we have to somehow be more specific or clarify. It has to be these jobs, these roles, these names, not SAP generically. It needs to be those specific names that I have provided.

Lem   4:14
Oh, OK, Yep.
Oh, I see.
OK.

Peter Wolf   4:27
Because we're getting generic SAP finance, I can understand if it gave something like that maybe, but there's other ones that are showing up that clearly they're just SAP job roles. But interestingly, if it was just SAP job roles broader, it should have given us a whole bunch of stuff. So I don't know why it's getting.

Bryan Wolf   4:44
Alright.

Peter Wolf   4:45
Some, but so far I haven't seen a single one that matched what we had. Now, it's not all that unusual. I mean, I don't think there's a whole lot of these postings out there, so I wouldn't expect to get a lot of them. But what we're getting is too generic. It's it's broader than what we're asking for.

Bryan Wolf   4:54
Right.

Lem   4:56
Yeah.
OK. I think, yeah, we also added a like a limit there. So I think, yeah, it's just getting like 10 or 20. But yeah, basically we could like add the limit to like 100, so to and then.

Peter Wolf   5:04
OK.
Yeah, I would say I would, I would add to 100. But again, I'm not expecting to see that many. I think the more critical issue is that the focus of getting the right ones.

Lem   5:15
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah, the we could. Uh, yeah, we could.

Bryan Wolf   5:23
No.

Peter Wolf   5:24
So I'd like to look at that. I'd like to look at what do we have actually have for the search criteria. Then on the company, on the company topic, again, we're getting a generic, very broad, very.

Lem   5:29
OK.

Bryan Wolf   5:39
Further report, you're saying?

Peter Wolf   5:39
Simplistic. Yeah, yeah. It's very broad, very pull one up, Brian, if you can. It's very broad, very simplistic report. It's not typically containing any of the financial stuff that was that's asked.

Lem   5:42
OK.

Bryan Wolf   5:45
Hey, here, let me just.
So this is what this is. Let's just pick our most recent one. So we ran, we ran a couple we ran. So we did Apple and together and then we ran whatever like these by ourselves. Let's just pick. Let's do well, a DuPont one was a tutorial, right? It's like.

Peter Wolf   5:55
Yeah, so it's getting the logo.

Lem   6:05
OK.

Peter Wolf   6:06
Right, like run the DuPont. Let's see the DuPont 'cause that was the one that I did.

Bryan Wolf   6:12
It was like, oh, this see, it's Lems. So the DuPont one's Lems. So if I go back to, I think, oh no, relax, relax, relax, relax, if I go to Lems.

Peter Wolf   6:17
Or just add duont right now on here.

Bryan Wolf   6:25
Oh well, we so we can't go there 'cause the labs got access. So hold on so.

Lem   6:26
Oh yeah, I I yeah, it's.

Peter Wolf   6:28
Yeah, just go plug duont on the bottom of the sheet or delete that line and put it in again at the bottom.

Bryan Wolf   6:33
OK, OK, hold on.

Lem   6:34
Yeah, we could, yeah, yeah. We you also need to delete the DuPont because, yeah, we have the duplicate, yeah. So the company name would then be.

Bryan Wolf   6:36
Well, I'd have to go turn these on.

Peter Wolf   6:41
Process.

Bryan Wolf   6:43
Yeah, it's already processed.

Lem   6:50
Mm.

Bryan Wolf   6:55
OK. No, OK.

Peter Wolf   7:04
Oh, send it to my Sarala. Sorry, take the e-mail from right above that and just paste it in.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   7:23
Oh, this just look different.

Lem   7:24
The company research.
Uh, I think it would be the first one. Yeah, it's the manual.

Bryan Wolf   7:31
I already got this first. I have the first one. It's already on. It's already on now.

Lem   7:37
Yeah, it's already on, so it should be.

Bryan Wolf   7:37
So might already be running.

Lem   7:43
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   7:43
Yeah.
I'm just gonna.

Lem   7:52
Uh, yeah, I think you could, uh, try to.

Bryan Wolf   7:54
Stop it.

Lem   7:58
Try to trigger again the.

Bryan Wolf   8:02
This thing.

Lem   8:03
Yeah.
The yeah, the check mark then.

Peter Wolf   8:12
And I'll put the check mark back in again.

Lem   8:13
Yeah, with the uh, yeah, good. Uh.

Peter Wolf   8:15
Because you just dragged it down from the upper one with the check mark already in it, I think you need to enter it, take the check mark out, put the check mark back in as the trigger.

Lem   8:21
Yeah, check. Check my. Yep. Yep, that's right. Uh.
OK.

Peter Wolf   8:53
See, this is where when we go into the Microsoft environment and we have Zoom info, we should be able to get this stuff confidently. We can use perplexity for say the latest news on the company, but we could get the financials and like their their technical stack and stuff like that, what systems they use.

Lem   9:06
OK.

Bryan Wolf   9:11
That's what Microsoft has access to.

Peter Wolf   9:13
Well, that that tool zoom info is a service you pay for and that we, you know, our company pays for for our sales guys so that we could access that and there you would be able to get that information confidently.

Bryan Wolf   9:25
So here we go. Here's the company report, so.

Lem   9:26
Oh, I see. Yeah.
The.

Peter Wolf   9:29
So let's see this. Just click on it.
So Scroll down. Integrating DuPont examples. Insirational content. This is like the overview stuff. Scroll down. There's more, isn't there? Yeah, keep going.

Bryan Wolf   9:44
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   9:45
Custom GPT configuring.

Bryan Wolf   9:46
See, look at this though. What? What is this? You know, that's 'cause we're pulling from your persona. I know, I know.

Lem   9:46
Oh.

Peter Wolf   9:50
It's using my writing style thing, so we shouldn't have my persona in there. We should have. We should have a better definition. Yeah, so it's getting confused that we're sending documents that are my writing style stuff.

Bryan Wolf   9:56
No.

Lem   10:03
Yeah, did you feed the persona on the like perplexity on the on the get the prompt. So yeah, the get the prompt should be like yeah, I think.

Peter Wolf   10:17
A separate document. Not my persona, but a a prompt document. Yeah, that's the wrong one. That's why.

Lem   10:21
Yeah, this is, yeah, this is a persona. So it should be the. Yeah, it should be the like the prompt, which is the.

Bryan Wolf   10:25
OK, So what am I putting here?

Peter Wolf   10:27
So.

Bryan Wolf   10:33
Do you have one in here? Did you? I don't know. Did you? I don't know. I don't. I never.

Lem   10:33
Um.

Peter Wolf   10:33
Did we ever even create one? Did we create one right? This is a prompt saying well OK, way back when we did this the first day, I think I had something I I gave which was the a structured company list of of scope that I wanted for the company.

Lem   10:39
Uh.
Yep. Uh.

Bryan Wolf   10:50
Uh, let me look.

Lem   10:53
Yeah, that's right. Let me just copy the. I think I can.

Bryan Wolf   10:54
Are you gonna look for it alone? I mean, I'm gonna look for it. You send it to him or you send it to me.

Lem   10:59
It it was on.

Bryan Wolf   11:00
I'm gonna look.

Peter Wolf   11:01
I put it in the chat. I think it was but.

Bryan Wolf   11:03
Is it in Outlook?

Lem   11:05
I can send you this link on the like dynamic prompt. Let me just yeah, share the.

Bryan Wolf   11:10
OK.

Lem   11:13
Uh.
We were OK, I'll send it on the yes. So this is actually the prompt because the we're we're just getting the prompt from a Google Doc, but it doesn't have the persona on it, so it's on the.

Peter Wolf   11:31
Yeah.

Lem   11:32
Uh, chat box here on Team Uh, Microsoft Teams.

Bryan Wolf   11:34
Sharon, OK, I see. Yeah, I want to be up here.

Yeah, so you could like.

Bryan Wolf   11:40
Oh, wait. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, OK, OK. I didn't know this is what we were doing. OK, alright, so I think that I think you already have this in your.

Lem   11:42
Yeah, this one.
Yep, this one.

Peter Wolf   11:48
So plug that in and let's rerun this. I think we're going to get a substantially different result.

Bryan Wolf   11:50
No, you're you're right. I think I put it in here and I didn't hear.

Peter Wolf   11:59
What we also need to do, Bryce, we need to start building a spreadsheet that's going to track what are the documents we're using in our flows, right? We need to keep clarity to OK, well, the the company flow has a prompt document. You know, the the newsletter uses my persona, the.

Bryan Wolf   11:59
Oh, these are all just.

Peter Wolf   12:18
You know, that kind of thing. We're going to need to set that U and manage that.
Because we're starting to create a lot of stuff.

Lem   12:27
Yeah, yeah, could be.

Bryan Wolf   12:28
OK, I gotta just. I gotta create a document for this for you. I gotta create one.

Peter Wolf   12:30
Yeah.

Lem   12:32
You could just, yeah, you could just copy paste the.
Document on the one with the link I think there.

Bryan Wolf   12:47
Hold on, let me let me do this.

Lem   12:50
Yeah, this one.

Peter Wolf   12:54
Up here.

Lem   13:06
Um.

Bryan Wolf   13:10
I see you.
You saw Ryan Bartosz. Can you talk? I do. You're coming.

Lem   13:20
Company research prompt. You could, yeah. Company research prompt. Yeah, yeah. So that it would be then, yeah, you we would need to map this one.

Bryan Wolf   13:21
And sure, I'll put it in the thing. I'm going to pull out five. What? There's a vicious on thing.

Lem   13:34
To the.
Yeah, this one company research prompt.

Bryan Wolf   13:42
Those are three, so it's three.

Lem   13:46
Mm.

Bryan Wolf   13:49
Come on, man.

Lem   13:51
Yep, that's fine.

Bryan Wolf   13:57
Yeah.

Lem   14:01
And then, yeah, no, it's.

Bryan Wolf   14:02
This might take a little bit, so it was refresh.

Lem   14:15
Yeah, this one component research prompt. Also, yeah, below you could just change also the other one.

Bryan Wolf   14:16
OK, now let's do it again. Yeah, what's up?
Is this? Oh, it says the same thing. Oh, doesn't it? Yeah.

Lem   14:25
Yeah, yeah, it's the same so that for the other one.
OK.
Yeah, you could just start it again.
Then I can check mark.
OK.
Uh.

Peter Wolf   15:43
But is this on my account we're looking at?

Bryan Wolf   15:47
Yes, it is, yeah.

Peter Wolf   15:48
So how can we see how many operations we've done in my account?

Bryan Wolf   15:53
How many scenarios we've made?

Peter Wolf   15:55
No, no operations. What we were saying with the kind of cost, the token approach, right, is operations. Wasn't there somewhere we look to see how many operations were processed? Just trying to because you said we had to restock the account, right, or had to pay for additional?

Lem   16:02
Yeah, on the make.

Bryan Wolf   16:07
We already did. We already did. That was for the APIs.

Peter Wolf   16:10
Yeah, so.
Right for for the.

Bryan Wolf   16:13
Like our ChatGPT API right now.

Peter Wolf   16:15
Hmm.

Lem   16:16
We could, yeah, we could check the yeah, this already done. Uh.
And then um.

Peter Wolf   16:23
close that one and go open new one.

Lem   16:26
Yeah, this is the new one. Yep, that one.

Peter Wolf   16:33
Much better.

Bryan Wolf   16:34
Yeah.

Lem   16:35
Alright, this has the.

Peter Wolf   16:35
Right. That's what was missing right away. That kind of concrete information, the financials, key products, this is what I was expecting.

Bryan Wolf   16:42
It's really cause I had the prompt, I had the I had your persona there.

Peter Wolf   16:44
You have their own. You have this persona prompt, but she wasn't telling it what to grab. So this is this is perfect. This is exactly what I was looking for.

Bryan Wolf   16:48
Yeah.

Lem   16:50
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   16:54
Yes, yes, this is what the Apple one looked like.

Peter Wolf   16:58
Yeah. OK. All right. This is, this is great, right? So I think, I think this is gonna be fine. And when we get the zoom info and we add the stuff for our our sales, sales force, then we'll be in good shape.

Bryan Wolf   17:00
That's it.

Lem   17:04
OK.

Bryan Wolf   17:16
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   17:16
Because that would be even more specific stuff. So we need to refine the job search piece to make sure. Can we look at what was the actual submission? Again, we were using a document there, right? We weren't plugging that in.

Lem   17:16
Mm OK.
Yep.
Yeah, we could.

Bryan Wolf   17:28
What do you mean? What do you mean? What submission for for the research company or the job search job scraping?

Lem   17:30
On the.

Peter Wolf   17:32
Perplexity for the jobs, the job search.

Bryan Wolf   17:34
Oh, I just backed out of it. Well, let's just can I see through the history?

Lem   17:38
Are the job search. It's actually on the appify. Yeah, it was on the other because this is just creating the no the on the make make.com and then you can go to #2.

Peter Wolf   17:42
Other one.

Bryan Wolf   17:48
This is it. This is the job scraper.
You talking about this? Uh.

Peter Wolf   17:56
The second flow.

Lem   17:56
Yeah, the 2nd flow.

Bryan Wolf   17:58
Hold on, relax. Stop. I just the things.

Peter Wolf   17:58
No, go to company. Company. Dude, calm down, man. You're the one getting twisted.

Lem   18:01
Company search, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   18:03
It's no look, it's freaking.

Lem   18:06
Um.

Bryan Wolf   18:07
This is an old thing. This is not the company thing. Yeah, yeah, hold on guys, guys, guys, it's the.

Lem   18:09
No, uh, the.

Peter Wolf   18:13
On number, yeah.

Lem   18:14
Yeah, yeah, that one.

Peter Wolf   18:17
Thank you.

Lem   18:22
Yep, this one. Yeah. So yeah, we could check it on the scrape indeed on the first module. Yeah, this one. Then yeah, the query is there like a SAP plus finance, so it's like a SAP.

Peter Wolf   18:37
Yeah, that's not it.

Lem   18:38
Space finance Uh.

Peter Wolf   18:40
Yeah, we can take that one out. Is that all the only those two?

Lem   18:42
SAP Treasury.
Uh, three. Yeah, it's only three. Uh, SAP Finance SAP.

Bryan Wolf   18:48
Yeah, Treasury.

Peter Wolf   18:48
I gave in the Brian. This is where I asked you to pull them out from the notes. It was SAPAPM, SAPAPMIHP, SAP Cash Management, SAP Treasury Management.

Lem   18:52
Uh, SAP Cash Management, Cash Management.

Bryan Wolf   18:59
Oh, right, right, right, right, right. Why don't you write this in the chat right now?

Peter Wolf   19:04
OK.

Lem   19:04
SEP um.

Peter Wolf   19:07
Hold on.

Bryan Wolf   19:10
Um, I did forget to e-mail this to you.

Lem   19:13
OK. Yeah, we could just add it. Yeah, here on the, yeah, I think it was. That's why it's different. Then could we could just add the filter so that it will just get this particular SAP.

Bryan Wolf   19:16
Open.
Yeah, right now, yeah.

Lem   19:33
Uh.
Uh, SAP cash punishment.

Bryan Wolf   19:40
Well, I should be treasuries there.

Lem   19:43
Yeah, Tashree. So the other one is.

Bryan Wolf   19:52
Uh, hold on. So how do I code this? Just I go below here and write enter and then I copy paste this.

Lem   19:53
Um, you could. Yeah, you could.
Uh.
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   20:05
Where? Which year?

Lem   20:06
There there on the after the column uh no the uh the quote and quote and then you should because the there uh it should be comma then space.

Bryan Wolf   20:07
Here.
Hello.
Oh, no. But this one, Lam or or this one? Which one?

Lem   20:17
No, the before that one, the after the cash management. So there like separator is comma. Yeah I know on the last after the quote.

Bryan Wolf   20:25
Like right here.

Lem   20:31
After the cache manage, yeah this one you could add a space, a comma after that one, yeah comma and then space and then quote and quote. Then you would put the link there the new link.

Bryan Wolf   20:32
Yes.
What do you mean code and code? Code like that?

Lem   20:46
Uh, a quote the the symbol quote and quote.

Peter Wolf   20:47
It's that that symbol.

Lem   20:52
Like the link is inside the this no same as this link. There's like a code the two codes.

Bryan Wolf   20:56
Like that?

Peter Wolf   21:04
Quote quotation marks.

Lem   21:05
Yeah, quotation mark. You could just actually just copy the link with a quotation mark. As you can see the HTTPS. Yeah, that one. So and then.

Peter Wolf   21:16
But you have to take the quotation mark with it, right?

Lem   21:19
Yeah, with the quotation mark.
Uh, you could. Uh, no.

Bryan Wolf   21:24
What about this queue?

Lem   21:26
Yeah, should it? It should be the queue jobs.
No, you could just delete this first and then you could copy the whole link because there's something missing also there. Yeah, so yeah, the whole link is from the quotation mark.
Yeah, that one. And then drag it down up to the next. Yeah, this one. Yeah, up to the quotation mark. Yep, that's right. OK And then Yep. And then we could just change the. Yeah, the after the Q is equal. That is the like the query.
Query and yes for the risk so the the space there is plus so you could just after the risk so add the I don't know just.
Yeah, after the SAP plus, yeah, SAP plus risk.

Bryan Wolf   22:23
I'm ******* this up. I'm sorry after I said P.
Mhm.

Lem   22:29
Basically when you we query phrase the example SAP space risk space management. So the space there is actually plus. Yeah, so you could add the plus there. Yep, that's right. And then.
Um, Yep. OK.

Peter Wolf   22:48
Yeah, because in that case, Brian, just to make sure you understand right, this is it's the it's saying go to the indeed dot job site and you need to find any job posting that has the word SAP plus the word risk plus the word management.

Lem   23:01
Yep, that's right. Yeah. Uh, and then.
Yeah, it's like it's searching the their query bar, query search bar there on the with this particular words. So SAP Advanced Payment Management, so something like that.

Peter Wolf   23:18
Isn't there a way where you you could do it as a list and you don't have to repeat the indeed over and over like you say SAP plus risk plus management or SAP plus cash plus management or SAP plus?

Lem   23:26
Uh.
No, it would depend on the scraper. Yeah, but for this one they would just add the per URL depending on the yeah so.

Peter Wolf   23:36
Isn't there a way to do that? OK.
OK.

Lem   23:47
Oh.
Uh.
And then, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   23:57
One more.

Lem   23:58
So.
Yeah, OK, this is good, I think.
Uh, SAP.

Peter Wolf   24:08
So you got you got one more advanced payment management you don't have in there, right?

Lem   24:12
Yeah, we yeah, it's already has the advanced payment management and then you could delete the last comma. Yeah, you could.

Bryan Wolf   24:14
Advanced.

Peter Wolf   24:15
Oh, hold on one more here.

Bryan Wolf   24:23
Let me just ignore.

Lem   24:25
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   24:26
Put in this last one in house bank, take out the hyphen, put SAP plus in plus house plus bank.

Bryan Wolf   24:41
OK, and I'll take out this last one. I'm right here. Now this looks good.

Lem   24:42
Yeah, the last comma. OK, yeah, yeah, this is, yeah, this, this looks good.

Peter Wolf   24:48
Scroll back up a second, you took out the one for finance or?
Yeah, good. OK, that's good.

Bryan Wolf   24:53
Look SAPAPM, SAP Treasurer, SP Cash Management, Risk Management, Treasury, Advanced Payment Management, Cash Flow Analyzer and In House Bank. OK, well, this is for the scraper.

Lem   24:54
Yeah, the.
Uh um.

Peter Wolf   25:02
Right, so let's run that now. Let's see what that does.

Lem   25:08
Yeah, but.

Peter Wolf   25:08
I know, but can't we trigger it manually?

Lem   25:11
I think we, yeah, we could figure it manually, but I think there's some error on the yeah, there's like a space. Let me just after after advanced payment management. Yeah, you should add a space after the comma. Yeah, that one.

Bryan Wolf   25:15
On the code here.

Lem   25:29
Yeah, because I think it would error out if there's like no space. Yeah, OK then. Yep, this is good. Click save. We can click save now then.

Bryan Wolf   25:31
Nice. OK, OK.
Uh, do I need to chew anything on here? No. All right.

Lem   25:39
For the.

Bryan Wolf   25:42
Company research.

Lem   25:43
Um.

Peter Wolf   25:44
No you don't.

Bryan Wolf   25:44
Good post JavaScript.

Lem   25:47
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   25:48
You don't. This gets the job, the the job search scraper. If it finds something, populates it here and triggers the company report, right? But so you can trigger the job search thing independent. What?

Lem   25:58
Yep. Yep. That's right. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   25:59
So should I write a new company here? So should I write a new company here? Should I write a new company here or it's gonna OK, so just just run it, OK?

Peter Wolf   26:03
No, no, that will not trigger the job search. The job search you should just run from from that from make right? Just trigger it.

Lem   26:03
No, no, no need, no need.
Yep, Yep, Yep, that's right. It will get the company from this one from this particular automation.

Peter Wolf   26:15
If it finds any matches to our to our content.

Lem   26:18
Yep, that's right. Yep. So what I would suggest also is we could add a filter after this one on the. As you can see there's like contains SAP filter there the first filter. So we could also add this particular name on there so that it it will.
Just filter out this particular job post. So if you click the one on the yeah that one on the middle, the middle of get data scrape and search for duplicate, there's actually like a filter there that just says SAP.
Yeah, so we could actually add here like, uh, the title. Uh, because the title is like the job title. Yeah, as you can see SAP Finance. So we could add here uh.
The no. So the title contains SAPAPM or SAP Treasury. So no we.

Peter Wolf   27:16
But didn't we already do that to tell it in the search? Shouldn't it already have filtered it?

Lem   27:21
Yeah, it but sometimes it also like adds like, yeah, or there's like there is SAP, but there is like different words there. So sometimes it also catches that one.

Peter Wolf   27:26
Grab some extra stuff that doesn't quite match.

Lem   27:38
So this is like a like a fall back. Yeah, like a fall back filter.

Bryan Wolf   27:38
So should I keep any of this?

Peter Wolf   27:39
So then this is a second. This is a second chance for it to look through and say, hey, you have to have this combination, so you want to relist all the combinations here.

Lem   27:45
Yep, that's right. Yeah.
Yep, that's right. So yeah, so we could just add it as like title and then contains SAP APM. So at the bottom it should be SAP APM. So we could just delete that the dynamic here.

Bryan Wolf   27:50
OK.
Mhm.
Delete. You want me to delete this. Delete that. You type in what? Type in.

Lem   28:05
Yep, that one. Yep, that's right. Yeah. And then like, type in SAPAP space APM. Yep. So, yeah.

Peter Wolf   28:14
Oh, so now you're just going to type them normally.

Bryan Wolf   28:18
Oh, you want me to type in all these other ones? Normally the SAP Treasury cash management, yes.

Lem   28:18
And then?
Yep, that's right. But it it should be on a different. It should be a a add end. It should be like end. Yeah, another line. So it would be an end rule. I mean, I mean, yeah that's right, but it would be or an or rule. So if the title has.

Peter Wolf   28:29
Another line.

Bryan Wolf   28:33
You're saying this stuff well, yeah.

Peter Wolf   28:35
Yeah.

Lem   28:41
SAP APM or yeah that one or the title has contains SAP APM IHB so it will pass through so.

Bryan Wolf   28:51
So on this top line in my on this top line I'm I'm.

Peter Wolf   28:53
You're just going to add each one of those individually as an or or SAPAPMIHB or SAP Treasury or SAP cash magnet.

Lem   28:54
Yeah.
Yeah, so it's like.

Bryan Wolf   29:00
So what about this text operators equal to? I don't need to do the equals to.

Lem   29:03
The contains you could the text operator should be contained so it should that's that means it contains that particular like phrase SAP treasury like that on the equal to.
Uh, yeah, that should be contains. Yeah, that's right. So something like that. Uh.

Bryan Wolf   29:21
Should I'm sorry. So then do I do I get rid of this text operator right here?

Lem   29:25
Yep, yeah, for the first first space, so that should be like the title. So the condition, yeah, the logic here is if the title contains SAP treasury, so it will pass through.

Bryan Wolf   29:33
This is the title.

Lem   29:41
Yep, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   29:42
So you don't. You don't have to again. Yeah, OK, no, I got it now. So you do have to resay the title you say or the title this. You don't just put the the text operator with the with the definition. You have to redefine again. This is this bucket or this bucket or this bucket and the bucket has to be identified.

Lem   29:46
Yeah, so it's like just a like a.
Yep, that's right.
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   30:01
Condition fully, OK.
It's going to say all those things have to be together, yeah.

Lem   30:14
Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah. So it's this is just like a fall back filter. So yeah, but yeah, Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   30:19
Yeah, got it. That's good. Extra, extra to make sure we don't get crap coming through.

Bryan Wolf   30:20
Mhm.

Lem   30:38
This is yeah. Then for this, yeah, I think we could set it up as like 100 or maybe try it 3030 lists for now so that test it out.

Bryan Wolf   30:51
What do you mean where?

Lem   30:53
Uh, later on the script indeed. So there's like a limit right on the on the.
Code there, so we we could change the limit to 30 or 50. Yeah, scrape so we could.

Bryan Wolf   31:06
OK.

Lem   31:14
Uh, SAP or smart man?
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   31:31
That's it.

Lem   31:35
And then click save.

Bryan Wolf   31:39
12345672367 Yeah, well, should we do the APM IH8 or just APM?

Lem   31:42
Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   31:50
You should do both SAPAPM and SAP. They're two different things. So I want them. APM is about advanced payment management. APM IHB is bad payment management in-house bank, so.

Lem   31:51
IPM.

Bryan Wolf   31:53
Alright, yeah, mhm.
OK.

Lem   32:04
SAP.
IH OK.

Bryan Wolf   32:14
OK, alright.

Lem   32:15
Yep, OK, that's we could just check the limit on the first appify on the on the first module.

Peter Wolf   32:17
So now let's.

Bryan Wolf   32:17
Now.
On.

Lem   32:27
No, no. On. Yeah, yeah, the first node. Yep. And then because there's a limit there, yeah, it's only 10, so we could change it to like 30 or, yeah, OK, 32 or 50 then.

Bryan Wolf   32:28
Oh, yeah. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Yeah, yeah.

Lem   32:42
Yeah, add this is for per URL, so this should be. Can you add the space after the colon? So yeah, I think this would error out if there's no after the before the number 30.

Peter Wolf   32:58
After the column.

Lem   33:01
Yep. And I think this should be if there's like a 30, yeah, I can change this to 10 so that, uh, there would be 10 risk.

Peter Wolf   33:02
Oh.
How many URLs are we looking at?

Lem   33:12
Um, yeah, I think we have 12345678 so.

Peter Wolf   33:17
Yeah, but we only wrote this for Indeed.

Lem   33:22
Yeah, these are all indeed. So basically what this means is per URL is per search query on the SAP APM. So per URL that's like per query. So there there would be.

Peter Wolf   33:36
No, that's not what I'm saying is instead of and this is, I just don't understand. So I'm looking for you to clarify. It has the URL we're searching plus what we want to search, but we didn't put that in for other websites, other URLs, we only put it in for Indeed.

Lem   33:38
Um.
OK.
Yep. Uh, yeah, yeah. This is only for indeed. Yep, that's correct.

Peter Wolf   33:54
So, but we're not searching those others or I'm confused.

Lem   33:58
I know, uh.

Peter Wolf   33:59
Are we only searching indeed.com?

Lem   34:01
Yeah, that's right. This is just an Indeed Indeed scraper. So it's just searching for the Indeed. So the the yeah, the input code is just structured this way, like Max rows per URL. But all of this are only scraping on Indeed, yeah.

Peter Wolf   34:08
Um.
OK, so we're not look, there's no other. I mean, yeah, I don't know that looking at just Indeed is going to be, is going to be the, you know, the, yeah, not everything. Oh, I don't know. I mean, maybe Indeed does get every job posting, but.
Let's start with that and we'll see what we get.

Lem   34:37
Uh.
Yeah, we could, yeah, we could also add like other, yeah, other websites here.
But yeah, you're seeing also, I think, yeah, that'll be fine.

Peter Wolf   34:50
Let's just go with that. Let's start for that and see what we get.

Lem   34:53
OK, um.
The.
Yeah, I think, uh, this is good. Uh, we could save it and test it out.

Bryan Wolf   35:08
OK.

Lem   35:25
Um.
Um, can we check the?
The data coming. Yeah, this one. The get data scrape data. Uh.
So we have how many can you check it?

Bryan Wolf   36:05
There's a lot of 70.

Lem   36:06
Yeah, yeah, we have 70, but only the only it passed through only one or no on our filter. I think it's.

Bryan Wolf   36:12
5.

Lem   36:21
Uh.
Hello.
I think we could see it on the like the SAP filter, but yeah, because this will still look with the other ones that are passing through.

Bryan Wolf   36:38
So which one? Which one do you want to look at?

Lem   36:38
Yeah, yeah, this one. Yep. So as you can see there, yeah, the other one didn't pass through the other bundles, so.
Oh, it already stopped. Yeah, so I think there is only one that passed through.

Bryan Wolf   36:53
I don't think it did any like you're saying like the like the actual title.

Lem   36:59
Yeah, the title. So there's only one that passed through because I actually processed up to the last one. So there's a job post that passed through with this particular names. So I think we could see it on the.

Peter Wolf   37:15
Spreadsheet.

Lem   37:16
Yeah, on the spreadsheet. Yeah, it's already on the spreadsheet. So you have this one.
Can you check it?
SAPS 4 uh, not. Uh, yeah, this is treasure.

Peter Wolf   37:28
Yeah, that's good. That's, that's, that's exactly. And I know they're an SAP shop too. So that's exactly what I'm looking for.

Lem   37:35
OK.
OK. Um.
Uh, Yep.
Only for issues and.
SAP solution. Yep. Then yeah, I think it also triggered the other automation, so we will get a couple of minutes or a couple of seconds. We will also get the company report from the Home Depot.
Um.

Peter Wolf   38:10
Yeah, right. So here is let me just show you what I did the same search with perplexity and I mean and I also asked ChatGPT what are the sites that are really most popular, most common for these skill sets?

Lem   38:10
Yep.
OK.
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   38:29
But you can see here perplexity. I I I didn't craft the prompt especially. Well, I just said find all companies that have the following skills and then I just listed them out right so.

Lem   38:43
OK. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   38:45
It's showing here this, I don't know why this APM asset performance management, that's not what we're looking for. So that might be 1 area where we get stuff that we wouldn't be expecting. But here's APM in-house bank.
And this is.
Uh, interesting.
Senior SAP Consultant Job Role Poland Advanced IT Career Senior SAP Consultant Remote.
SAP Treasury, here's.
This is on indeed, it says.

Lem   39:28
Oh, so you're you're basically like searching for job posts from perplexity, right? With that particular skill set? Yeah, OK.

Peter Wolf   39:35
Yeah.
Yeah.
Again, because I I think looking at indeed is gonna be too is gonna be too narrow.

Lem   39:39
Yeah, I think it's also.
Yeah, yeah, that's also.

Peter Wolf   39:46
Financial planning.
Yes, Village Treasurer SAP engineer.

Lem   39:56
Thanks.
H.

Peter Wolf   40:08
Yeah. So I wasn't specific enough, right, that I had to have those combinations. SAB Treasury and cash management consultant lead.

Lem   40:17
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   40:17
Is this Deloitte or Accenture Accenture?

Lem   40:19
Yeah, I think this is, yeah, from their website, own website I think.

Peter Wolf   40:22
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   40:26
Yeah.
I love it.

Peter Wolf   40:57
Mhm.
And I think we should probably do this as well, add a perplexity search, but make the prompt more specific like yours.

Lem   41:06
Mhm.
OK.

Peter Wolf   41:14
As if he.
This one on the Cash Management Treasury Risk Management Senior Consultant.

Lem   41:34
I think that we there's also like.
Yeah, but if yeah, if we use like perplexity or like other LM, yeah, this would be much broader because it will like search for the whole Internet for the.

Peter Wolf   41:50
Yeah. So I think we should add that. I I think we should add a.

Lem   41:51
Then.
Yeah, like.

Peter Wolf   41:55
Perplexity search, but again it should use we need a we need a structured prompt that's really tight because you can see right here the way I'm doing it, it's bringing back a variety of things. We also what we said was did we ever add?
Did we add a function that if the company was already on the spreadsheet, we don't add it again or something? OK.

Lem   42:18
Yep, yeah, there's like a deduplicate. Yep, it's already on there. So yeah, it will search the.
For it on the Google sheet and then if there is a match on the company name it won't pass through. So we have the filter for that.
Jobs that.
OK.
Delaware.

Peter Wolf   44:02
Yeah.

Lem   44:05
I see because for the.
I think there's also a good LinkedIn job post scraper here on Arpify.
Yeah, looking at job scraper.

Peter Wolf   44:47
This is the company that we're doing the that we're working to sign the $5,000,000 contract with right here.

Bryan Wolf   44:53
Really RTX?

Lem   44:54
RTX.

Peter Wolf   44:55
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   45:07
Zip recruiter. Umm
Zip recruiter.

Peter Wolf   45:14
Right, while we're doing that, can you take take some of those other names that are on the company sheet, re take the check mark out, remove the document and then rerun the put the check mark in again to see how the how the report looks.

Bryan Wolf   45:28
Huh. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, OK, here let me do uh.
Yeah.

Lem   45:55
Sip.

Bryan Wolf   46:01
Now, Lem, if I want to do this, can I do a bunch at one time or no one time?

Lem   46:05
Um, uh, no.
Yeah, it will just process one by one, but like it will be on the queue. So yeah, you could also do it.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   46:22
So like if I wanted to do, I could just click them all and then do it right?

Lem   46:27
Yep, that's right. Yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   46:27
Like, OK.
And these won't be effective, right?

Lem   46:35
Um, the one that has processed already? Yeah, so it won't be.

Bryan Wolf   46:35
OK.
Yeah, they won't go, but I'm talking about these other ones, these like 7 or whatever it is.

Lem   46:42
Yep, let me just check it again.

Bryan Wolf   46:50
And I run it. Should I run it or should I?

Lem   46:51
Uh.
Oh, ****.
Yeah, so it's already here. Yep. OK.

Bryan Wolf   47:04
Good.

Lem   47:05
Yep, you could. Uh, yeah, check it. Mark all then.
Yeah, it will, uh, pick it up.

Bryan Wolf   47:13
Oh ****, it's already running.

Lem   47:17
Yeah, it's OK. Uh, it will just look, uh, look back with all the search rows there.

Bryan Wolf   47:24
Mhm.
I unclicked them and clicked them again or whatever.

Lem   47:33
Yep. So as you can see, this already second batch. Yeah, so #2.
Yeah, we could also check if it's already like correct like the output for. So I think there's already process also already process one.
So we could check it on the.

Bryan Wolf   48:27
I processed a bunch. This is a bunch. OK, so.

Lem   48:29
Yeah, um.

Bryan Wolf   48:32
Let's do a sound chair.

Lem   48:40
Um.

Bryan Wolf   48:40
How's this look to you, Jen?

Peter Wolf   48:42
Yeah, go back up a second. Hold on, hold on.
Yeah, yeah. I mean what would be what what we probably want to do is try to refine it more the structure, but this is, this is really fine, right? Because I think the data is going to come out different for different companies. I was thinking of something, you know, more structure like revenue for 2022, revenue for 20.

Lem   48:58
Yep.

Peter Wolf   49:08
24 or whatever that. But this is, this is certainly good enough. It's concise. You can still read through it even though it's in paragraph form. I think that's good. Key products, Entry affair service, cloud applied intelligence, digital. OK, Scroll down.

Lem   49:09
Yep.

Peter Wolf   49:27
Oh, geez.
Yeah, I think we're gonna get a lot of that not having clarity to what the answer is. I think that's fine. Go check on some of those other ones.

Bryan Wolf   49:32
Yeah.
This one's got more data.

Lem   49:50
Yeah, so this says.

Peter Wolf   49:51
Yeah. And that's more structured, right? See the way that's structured?

Lem   49:54
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   49:55
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   49:57
Yeah.

Lem   50:00
Yeah, I think it would also depend on like the output. Yep, that's right, the output on perplexity. So the yeah, it it it would depend on.

Peter Wolf   50:00
Yeah, that's great.
How they find it? Where they find the data? Yeah, the strong, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   50:11
See, this one's. This is one of the smaller ones.

Peter Wolf   50:15
Yeah. And some of these companies are much smaller companies too, so you're not going to have as much. And that's very specific, which is too. No, that's the parent company, not a subcompany.
Me.
Plug in, plug in. Uh, Owens. Do we have go back to the list a second?

Bryan Wolf   50:38
Still waiting. Still waiting. We get a couple of minutes.

Peter Wolf   50:38
Oh.
I was still waiting on that one, OK.
Login RTX.

Bryan Wolf   50:49
Are you gonna wait? Or if I put this in now, I'm gonna wait to the process stuff.

Lem   50:54
Um.

Bryan Wolf   50:57
I don't think I'm gonna just plug in. Why is this? Yeah, she said in this stuff.

Lem   50:59
Yeah, the yeah, there's uh.

Peter Wolf   51:01
Those are websites giving you multile website addresses.

Lem   51:05
Yeah, this, I think it's uh.

Bryan Wolf   51:09
One more for Allen's Corner.

Lem   51:09
Multiple websites, that's why it's.

Peter Wolf   51:14
You can squeeze that road down so that even though there's a whole bunch of data in there, it doesn't just grab it at the line right there. Yeah, exactly.

Lem   51:47
I think it's, uh, yeah, it's still processing the.

Bryan Wolf   51:49
Didn't catch this wrong.
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   51:54
Because uh.

Bryan Wolf   51:58
I'll update, it just takes a couple minutes.

Lem   51:58
OK.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   52:03
And the last one here so.

Lem   52:12
Yeah, I think there's like a like a duplicate because it this is already turned on right the automation and then we run it once again so it like process twice for all of the.

Bryan Wolf   52:26
Mhm.

Lem   52:27
Company. But yeah, it's.

Bryan Wolf   52:29
So here's Owen's tab.

Peter Wolf   52:31
OK. Yeah. See, that's good structure there, right? That's awesome. Scroll down.

Lem   52:35
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   52:39
Yeah, that's good. Nice, quick, concise bullet points focused.
Yep, it does nice 'cause that's where we get like the where a zoom info would be able to supplement information there.

Bryan Wolf   53:04
Almost recent news articles.
This is great. I think this is good.

Peter Wolf   53:07
Yep, good deal. That. Yeah, this looks that looks great for sure.

Lem   53:11
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   53:17
Alright now.

Peter Wolf   53:18
OK.
So then I uh.

Lem   53:22
Yeah, I think we could. You could already stop that. This one, right? Yeah. Because it's duplicating the. Yep. Yeah, because, yeah, it's already actually turned on. So Yep.

Peter Wolf   53:23
Lem work.

Bryan Wolf   53:29
Thanks then. Yeah, appreciate that. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   53:35
So can we can we then look at? So we we seem like we addressed the company information. We got a better prompt, right? We got the right prompt. We have and indeed, we're now narrowing our search. We didn't find anything really, right? We didn't come up with anything, did we? Or we did. We found the Home Depot 1, right?

Lem   53:38
Uh.
Uh, Yep, the one one. Uh, we.

Peter Wolf   53:55
OK. So so again, I'm not expecting mass volume on that, but if it's running every day, we'll see. If one pops up, we'll see it and that's fine. Then what I wanted to do was look at the at the.
The the search for both the news articles and then the.
Social media. So can we go to the news articles and let's look at the Innovator.

Lem   54:22
OK, the use data flow.

Bryan Wolf   54:25
I'm trying to get this to four stop. It won't stop.

Lem   54:29
Um.
Oh, it won't. It sets.
Can you click it again? The four stop? It's not. Yeah, maybe it's just glitching out, I think.

Bryan Wolf   54:40
So let's see. I think it was switching. Yeah, it's fine. OK, So what do you want to say again, Pete?

Lem   54:43
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   54:46
Let's go look at the Inno reader.

Lem   54:50
The.

Bryan Wolf   54:53
Yours is.
Mine's a little bit got more than yours, but yeah.

Peter Wolf   54:57
Yeah, mine's the one I'm worried about.

Lem   55:01
Yeah, I think we we didn't add here a rule yet because it's all unread. No.

Bryan Wolf   55:02
There it is.
A rule in make or a rule on a narrator?

Peter Wolf   55:09
But let's OK, let's let's go pick a few. Let's go pick a few and then see what?

Lem   55:12
Here on Inoreader.

Bryan Wolf   55:21
OK, so tell me what to do.
Markets.

Lem   55:31
Just there.

Peter Wolf   55:32
OK, now how do I put a unique selection criteria? What is it that I would put here? Where do I? Where do I do that then?

Lem   55:37
Uh.
Yeah, you could click the Financial Times Markets, the title, Yep, the header. And then there's like a filter feed.

Peter Wolf   55:44
To the header, yeah.
Filter feed. Yeah, OK.

Lem   55:50
Uh yeah, this one. And then uh, filter content.

Peter Wolf   55:55
OK.

Lem   55:55
Yeah, and then the title or content uh contains.

Peter Wolf   55:58
Title or content right contains. So you leave it there, then go to the next one. So title or content contains and then put in here whole words only. Now are we saying do you? Is it like boolean? Do I have to say this word plus this word plus this word or do I just list the words or what do we do? What's their format?

Lem   56:00
Yeah, let's say.
Yeah, contains.
OK.
Uh, it's just uh like a word and then for example uh AI or a phrase.

Peter Wolf   56:20
And then I'd add another condition, add another condition and it is it a is it a is it an and or an or like is the if I add another condition is an and or nor it's an and.

Lem   56:24
Yes, that's right. Yeah.
Yeah, it's an end, yeah.
Yeah, it's an end. Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   56:32
OK, so uh.

Lem   56:34
So for the and you could also choose because we have like remove articles here. So you could click the keep articles as you can see below the Financial Times markets. Yep.

Peter Wolf   56:43
Uh, we're we're that would be excluding articles. OK, so click keep articles and then let's put let's put artificial intelligence. This is already Financial Times, right? But can I say OK, so then I would say if I wanted it to have these words and these words and then I just put another one here, I put artificial.

Lem   56:46
Yeah. So this is, yeah.
Yep. Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   57:03
And if we click on the end condition, Nope, down there on the left below title. Yep. Oh, and it has a choice and or or. OK, so now put.

Lem   57:03
Yep, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   57:07
Where? Oh, here.

Lem   57:09
Yeah, this one. Yep. And AI.
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   57:17
Uh, finance.
Finance.
And then click the and put or. In this case put or. Oh, so now you can't do or. If you did and for the other one, it's all ands or ors. You can't do a combination of an and and an or.

Lem   57:38
Uh.

Peter Wolf   57:40
And look like.

Bryan Wolf   57:41
Yeah, I know.

Lem   57:42
Oh yeah, I think it would just, yeah, it's just and or or, but you could add like, yeah, different.

Peter Wolf   57:51
I'd save that filter and create another filter. Can you save more than one filter? So let's just save that right now. Save that filter.

Lem   57:57
This is, uh, yeah, it should be end, right? Yeah. And then.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   58:06
OK, see all articles. So this is what I want to do, right? This is where I want to refine it and say, OK, what would I got in here by doing this? US removes open, moves open, blah blah blah. Biden wilderness like.

Lem   58:13
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   58:19
Yes. So we can't make it known. It's just you just build on top of the other one.

Peter Wolf   58:23
****, you only have one. That's pretty bad. Like cause I look at that and say this is what's filtering. I can't believe that some of these articles don't possibly have the word artificial intelligence in them.

Lem   58:23
Um, yeah, it's.
Um.
Uh, no, I think uh this.

Bryan Wolf   58:38
But it's got listen, you have the word finance. It's the Financial Times, man. You have the word finance in that. It's such a broad word.

Lem   58:42
No, I.

Peter Wolf   58:45
But finance has got AE on the end of it, not financial.

Bryan Wolf   58:48
OK. Well, Financial Times, I mean, I'm sure their finance comes up and.

Peter Wolf   58:51
But I mean, it's it's supposed to be looking for very specific words, right?

Bryan Wolf   58:55
Yeah, but if the word finance is anywhere in here, City of London is losing its sheens, like if the word finance could be anywhere in there and have no relevancy to actual finance.

Lem   58:55
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   59:02
Could be, but what about artificial intelligence?
It seems unlikely that we see, we said and.

Bryan Wolf   59:07
Well, I don't think it's saying. I don't think it's saying it needs both. It's saying.

Lem   59:07
I think, uh, we we should change the filter.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   59:14
Well, why don't we look out? Let's find out.

Peter Wolf   59:18
Scroll down, let's see what else.

Lem   59:18
So.

Bryan Wolf   59:20
Oh, I can't even click on Excel.
I'm not subscribed, but I don't think I can.

Peter Wolf   59:27
Uh, so we have. Yeah. How does that work? If we get the article through the API and we're not subscribed, do we still get it?

Lem   59:35
Yeah, the I think we could get the like the summary. Yeah, we could get.

Peter Wolf   59:40
The problem is, if we include that in our thing and people click on it, they're not gonna get it, right? They're not gonna be able to get to it.

Lem   59:45
Yeah, yeah, that's the only.

Bryan Wolf   59:46
Yeah, well, that's the Financial Times. You're they're not. You have to be subscribed to get any article from them, from any outlet, you know, just like any other news, news, you know, station that has to paywall behind it.

Lem   59:49
Yeah, I think, yeah.
Yeah, there's they they have the paywall, but so yeah, if they click, actually click the link, they won't be, I think, yeah, they won't read the particular article because there's like a paywall.

Peter Wolf   1:00:02
Oh.
They'll get a link to it. They'll see the header. They'll see like the first part of the article. Like most of the time you get in, then it would say you need to access. Yeah, wow, that's a limitation, isn't it?

Lem   1:00:12
Yeah, just that, yeah.
That's right.
Um, yeah, for this. Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:00:22
So unless we use sources that are free sources, then we would have that limitation. But Scroll down some more, Brian, let's just see what all the other titles are.

Lem   1:00:32
I think this is this wasn't filtered. Yeah, this is not the filtered because as you can see it's already like 5 weeks and.

Peter Wolf   1:00:36
That's not the filtered.
But see right there it says see all articles. Where do we say see filtered articles?

Lem   1:00:45
Yeah, yeah. As you can see, there's a can you click this one? Yeah, 454 matches today. Yeah. So this ones are.

Peter Wolf   1:00:48
Oh, there you go. There you go. Click that.
Guarantee Trust listing long time I'm I'm human. Are you the quest for online identity? Sentiment sours. US Oil Patch, BlackRock, Schroeder, Chris.
Uh.

Lem   1:01:05
Yeah, I think it's not. If we put the finance, I think it would, yeah, it would.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:06
It just seems like a lot of slop, you know? Yeah, that's not really. There's no way around that. It's.

Peter Wolf   1:01:08
Yeah.
Take the finance out and just put AI and let's see what we get.

Lem   1:01:16
Yeah, I think it should better. It will do better if we filter it out. Yeah, not just.
Artificial intelligence or AI?

Peter Wolf   1:01:29
Oh, 453 today.

Lem   1:01:29
Um, no, it's just a.
Uh, no. But it's still. I think it's still.
Um.
It's still processing because this the problem actually I think it it didn't process new new feed because there's more than 100 unread articles on that particular.
Feed on Financial Times. That's why the first thing that I I we we need to do, yeah, is to like the create the rule that whenever there's a new feed, it would be automatically unread. But yeah, we could just click the red here.

Peter Wolf   1:02:01
Empty everything.

Lem   1:02:13
On the upper right side, so that all on the all articles would be read on finance and economics so that it would update on real time. Yep, that this one. So yeah.
Um.
Yeah, show filtered content.
I think we we just filter it out on Financial Times, right? It's not on the whole news feed. So can you go back to, yeah, the final, yeah, that is like all.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:39
The same thing. I think it's just glitching a little bit.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:02:47
All right, this is everything.

Lem   1:02:55
Um, yeah, this one. I think this is the.
Um.
Uh, this is. Yeah, I think this is filtered out because as you can see, there's like a.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:03
No.

Lem   1:03:10
Yeah, initially removed this article. So this is not actually, yeah, this is.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:15
The new one. It's this is the finance one too.

Lem   1:03:18
The.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:19
Finance and AI.

Lem   1:03:22
No, I I think we could. Can you go back to all articles, click the all articles and then just click the.
Uh.
Yeah, I think this is the field, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:03:36
It was saying right there, filtered, filtered content, right?

Lem   1:03:39
Yeah, this is the filtered one. No, don't show the filtered one. Yeah, so I think this is the much more the filtered one as you can see.
No, this is older. Yes, you can. As you can see right on no filters up applied because the filter is just 30 days. Yeah, yeah, that's right. So this is the.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:55
I don't know.
So it's just this one, four weeks.

Peter Wolf   1:04:06
So that's the only one that has the words artificial intelligence in it.

Lem   1:04:10
Yep. Yeah. On Financial Times markets, yeah, that's right. So as you can see, there's if you click this one, yeah, there's like a bank was goes for artificial intelligence. So I think this is.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:10
Or the Financial Times markets.
In the last month.

Peter Wolf   1:04:23
Is there is there some other something else? Financial Times calling something else other than markets or is that the only one?

Lem   1:04:30
No, they're they're actually, yeah, a lot of like on, yeah, on Financial Times like.

Peter Wolf   1:04:32
So if you put in Financial Times.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:33
I think there is.
There's like a bunch of different times markets, but so Times UK homage, Financial Times overall, but it's only 4K followers. So it's like, you know, I don't know if this is really the Financial Times.

Peter Wolf   1:04:50
Yeah, but that, but no, but that doesn't matter how many followers are. Financial Times is go to the main one right there and let's try that one and see what we get when we put in artificial.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:56
I just called. I followed it. OK, so let's do.

Lem   1:05:06
Yep. And then filter. I think we could add here title or content contains artificial intelligence and also AI on ad condition or AI so that it would because sometimes the articles just mention AI and not.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:24
Yeah.

Lem   1:05:34
Um.

Peter Wolf   1:05:34
Together, right? That's the only thing. I'm not sure. Can you click on the contains? Can you click on that contains and see what other options is begins with, ends with matches regular, doesn't match regular? Yeah, see, I think that's going to look for anywhere that it's going to find anywhere that there's a word AI in it. So let's start without that.

Lem   1:05:34
Um.
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:05:53
Cut that one off first. Let's just do artificial intelligence first.

Lem   1:05:53
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:05:58
I agree that it'd be better to do, you know, the combination of AI because a lot of Times Now everybody just writes AI and then I won't write it out full time, you know?

Lem   1:06:06
Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:07
Just one match, but it's not showing up.
I don't think I read.

Peter Wolf   1:06:17
Well, the fact that there was one match in the other would have to mean in the general one there would have been at least one match.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:21
It was the same one, yeah.
Got my lessons?

Lem   1:06:35
Yeah, I think this is, uh, it's still processing, I think, but.
Yeah, these are all unread, so.
Can you click? Yeah, can and then.
Um, it's OK. Can you go back up and on the upper left side? So um, yes, I think it didn't filter anything.
On all articles.
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:07:10
And let's go back and put AI and see what it does.

Lem   1:07:18
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:07:19
Just change that one to AI. Nope, take it off. We didn't find anything for artificial done. Just change the AI. Delete that next line, you know?
Yes, see that Taiwan Tai, right?

Lem   1:07:44
Yeah, I think it's also.

Peter Wolf   1:07:45
CD.
Although there's Gulf's ambitious bet on AI.

Lem   1:07:50
Yeah.
But I think, can you go back? Can you click this? Taiwan develops. Maybe there's also like AI. Yeah, there's AI strike systems. As you can see, autonomous weapons have same.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:59
I think there is talking about.

Peter Wolf   1:08:01
Oh, might be.
OK, OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:03
Yeah, I don't think. I don't think it's pulling the word like the AI in the word.

Lem   1:08:06
Yeah, I think it's a whole word because there's like on the filter, there's like cool words right on the.

Peter Wolf   1:08:09
OK.
So close that a second. Let me say again, close it.
Chinese brands expect global reach, FDAV further reading, Gulf Ambition, the bottom free for sure, right?

Lem   1:08:26
We could also like not just filter on the title, like if the title has AI and not on the content, because I think most of there are lots of content that.
Like has the AI on it so.

Peter Wolf   1:08:41
Right, right. Convention this, this might be an impact to AI in one sentence, right? Just that's it. But if it's not the main point, you're right. I think the header probably is the way to go.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:46
Yeah.

Lem   1:08:47
Yep, that's right. Yeah.
On yeah, the title because on the field.

Peter Wolf   1:08:52
Now we already know it's not gonna be, it's gonna be less than that, right? Because we've got that many with title and body. And so if you put title, it's gonna be.

Lem   1:08:57
Yep, that's right. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:59
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. I just I this is remove articles.

Lem   1:09:01
Oh yeah, that's remove articles. I think that's why. Can you?

Peter Wolf   1:09:03
Sh.
All right, click keep and then change it to title, not just not content with it.

Lem   1:09:11
Yeah, keep articles and just the if title. So we could actually if title, yeah, contains AI. Yep. And then save. Yep. So this is the filtered one.

Peter Wolf   1:09:23
Much better, right? Target risk. So now how do we get something better? Something specific? Let's see what happens if you go now add and and.

Lem   1:09:26
No.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:26
Oh, I mean, ****, I don't know. I think. I think this seems like.

Lem   1:09:27
No.
Yeah, no, this this is the filtered one. So unfiltered. This is the unfiltered. Yeah. So can you go back to, yeah, just unclick that one. Yeah. So this is the. I think that this four is the one that as you can see all the titles of AI.

Peter Wolf   1:09:37
Uh huh. And that's got 200 and something, right?
Yep, Scroll down.

Lem   1:09:53
Yeah. So the yeah, the other one that doesn't have a filter because they are, yeah, they are more than more than 30 day. Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:56
These are not. They're not filtered. They're not filtered with the ones. So these all have AI in the title. These are the only ones with AI in the title, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:09:59
Oh, oh, OK.
Uh, so there's only four recent articles, and you said it only looks back 30 days or something.

Lem   1:10:05
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, 30 days.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:07
Yeah.

Lem   1:10:09
So uh.

Peter Wolf   1:10:10
So none of them. I will roll AI roll out China delayed by Trump trade war. Gulf ambitious bet on AI. Click on that one. Oh, we can't see it because we don't have the rights to it.
We don't have a subscription, which again, what good is it if we're sending this to them and they can't get to it because.

Lem   1:10:26
Yeah, just uh.
Can I? I'm not sure if this is. Can you click this? Also the link can you click the?
Uh, no, the.
The Financial Times, I think. Yeah, this one. Oh, right. It's a different one. I think the.

Peter Wolf   1:10:48
The header go to the title, click on that and what happens when you click on the title all the way up.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:49
That's problem.

Lem   1:10:55
Yep, I think this. Yeah, there's a like a paywall, right. So we could, we can.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:58
Yep, another paywall.

Peter Wolf   1:10:58
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:03
Oh, how are they getting the information then?

Lem   1:11:03
Yeah, so there's like a pair of.

Peter Wolf   1:11:04
Yeah.
You what?

Lem   1:11:08
Yeah, but for the summary, yeah, they actually can get, yeah, the like summary of the article.

Peter Wolf   1:11:13
So we'll get the summary, but when anybody clicks one, so we get a summary, we get the title, but we don't really get the article.

Lem   1:11:15
Yeah, it's just that when they, yeah, when they click it, they can't read the the inside it because there's like a paywall. So that's actually a problem. So maybe Financial Times.

Peter Wolf   1:11:26
Yeah, what the hell are you about that?

Lem   1:11:30
Um, I'm not sure if Financial Times has like a free article list something or blog.

Peter Wolf   1:11:32
I do not that.
I think you I know that on these eyes like it's like you get three a month or something like that free or something like that. That's what I on some of these you get a couple a month free.

Lem   1:11:48
OK, so they don't have like a public access right for.

Peter Wolf   1:11:53
Doesn't look like, doesn't appear that way.

Lem   1:11:55
Yeah, that would be, yeah, that's a problem. When they click the link, yeah, they couldn't. They won't be able to read all the full article.
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:12:13
Yeah, yes, OK. But this is, this is what I need to do. It's really by source. We need to figure out more specifically like go, go back in, Brian and go to one of the other ones. It's more of a technology.

Lem   1:12:14
Yeah.
So I think we could, we could just.

Peter Wolf   1:12:29
Site. It's more or we did all finance sites. They aren't. We did all finance stuff. Click on The Economist and let's try. And is The Economist a paywall site too? Let me just see Economist articles.

Lem   1:12:49
Oh.

Peter Wolf   1:12:54
Or we could do, you know, I had picked those other sites. We we said we couldn't find them. I could. I could do a scraper though I had. I paid to have a developer build a scraper.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:03
Is MIT technology review?
This is technology on.

Peter Wolf   1:13:09
OK, so if you put finance, do a search of articles and put in finance.
Let me fix AI's evaluation crisis.

Lem   1:13:25
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:13:30
Can you click on that one evaluation crisis?

Lem   1:13:31
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:36
3.

Peter Wolf   1:13:37
Yeah, hold on a second. Oh.
Yeah, I don't know. This might be really harder than I'm thinking here.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:00
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:14:03
I need to make this work though. I gotta come up with a way to make this work. I'm trying to think what others.

Lem   1:14:07
Yeah, I think, I think we could, we could do it via like finance websites and then so that because you need like finance news, right, that has AI. So yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:14:20
That's what I'm really looking for. So it's really I need to be searching finance websites and looking for technology commentary, right?

Lem   1:14:26
Yep, that's right. So because on I think on finance websites it it would be easily filtered out via like AI or like technology or something because most of the businesses is also.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:27
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:14:35
Yeah, yeah, the the issue gets back to again fire paid firewall, not paid firewall. So if I go to.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:37
Mhm.

Lem   1:14:42
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:45
Well, maybe if you subscribe to a bunch, but I don't think we can just copy and paste the data from it, but.

Lem   1:14:45
We could.

Peter Wolf   1:14:48
I know, but us subscribing to them doesn't matter, right? It's what the people who are reading it.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:51
Yeah, but at least subscribe when we copy and paste the data from it specifically and just I I don't know if we get charged or something for doing that, but yeah.

Lem   1:14:51
Yeah, because I.

Peter Wolf   1:14:58
No, but it's not that I'm I'm not gonna put the whole article in no matter what, right? So.

Lem   1:15:03
Yeah, they they won't be able to read it, I think because they don't if they don't like subscribe. So even I think that's.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:03
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:15:09
Yep, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:10
Right, but if we just copy and pasted all the material and it's set up in some sort of like Google Doc or some sort of spreadsheet that they could go to and just click on and look at but.
Give me one.

Peter Wolf   1:15:39
Hold on a second.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:40
Up here.

Peter Wolf   1:15:42
Where did I have it just a second ago? Here we go.
Websites.
OK.
Uh.
So look up Global Finance Magazine, Global Finance Magazine.

Lem   1:16:06
Yep, I yeah, this one.

Peter Wolf   1:16:10
O click on that.

Lem   1:16:16
Yeah, it's OK, the 13 followers, because I think it's just on I know reader.
Yeah, I think this one is, uh, public, I think. Can you?

Peter Wolf   1:16:30
It is. It is. That's what I'm saying. So here's an example and look at they have actually even a section, a technology section. And when I look in there, I see like, OK, this is great. How's digital innovation is shaping future banking? See, that's the promise. A I doesn't have to be in the header.

Lem   1:16:32
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:16:49
That's the problem is I don't really. The word AI doesn't need to be in there because I'm looking at broader technology. I'm looking at this is where the this is where.

Lem   1:16:52
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:17:00
We're chat TPT doing a filter, which ones are the best ones is really the best we can do, but we need to go to a site like this and we need to somehow narrow it down because we don't want to feed.
When we said when we feed the the summaries from, we grab summaries here, right? And we feed them to Chat GPD. Is every summary a is every summary an operation or no? We feed them all massive list of summaries. It's one operation.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:25
Yeah.

Lem   1:17:26
Yep.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, just one operation because it's already aggregated on the next. So the all the bundles is already just one operation. Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:17:44
OK, so then Brian, go go into this one here, go into this here and then let's just add them to a feed.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:55
It's already on. I already put it in.

Peter Wolf   1:17:57
OK, can we go into filters? I'm trying to think of it. Is it gonna be? Is their filter the same? Like the filter is really? Yeah, the filter is really the Eno reader filter. It's not like a unique filter per per source.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:10
What do you mean a filter? Like a filter for the?

Lem   1:18:11
Yeah. Oh.

Peter Wolf   1:18:12
Well, meaning the functionality, the filter functionality is the is in a reader's filter functionality. It's not like each source gives you different ways to filter their content. Like I'm saying, I look here and I can see I'm at the website and I can see these guys have have a, you know, a a technology section, right?

Lem   1:18:21
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's, it's.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:22
Yeah.

Lem   1:18:31
Oh, OK, I think. Can you search back again? Maybe there's like on the, yeah, on the Global Finance magazine because Financial Times also have like a subsection, right? So maybe, maybe they also have.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:35
Global Finance Magazine Finance.

Peter Wolf   1:18:36
On the global finance plan, maybe they have a subset.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:42
Market share.

Peter Wolf   1:18:44
So global finance.
Global Finance Magazine and then see if there are others below it.
Global Banking and Finance Review Magazine. Global Finance.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:57
Recent articles back in finance.

Peter Wolf   1:19:02
That's a different website, right? Global Finance current issues. That's just ****, huh?

Lem   1:19:03
Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:04
Current issue. That's it.

Lem   1:19:06
Uh, yes. So they don't have the. Yeah, they don't have the.
Um.

Peter Wolf   1:19:13
See, this is where maybe my scraper.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:13
There's an there's an import, there's an import feeds button here.

Peter Wolf   1:19:18
Is what?

Bryan Wolf   1:19:18
Import feeds.

Peter Wolf   1:19:21
Yeah, that's what we're looking at is the feed. Oh, import other feeds.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:25
Yeah, our own, I think.

Peter Wolf   1:19:27
If we wanted to have other fees or something, see maybe my scraper going to these websites would be better than than Inno reader because my scraper which I haven't used in a long time but.
We had it set up so it would go to all these websites. It would pull all the articles and put them into a spreadsheet and update in a document, a massive document that had all the articles.

Lem   1:19:48
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:19:59
Like here, let me see if I still have this. I mean, maybe.

Lem   1:19:59
OK.
I think, yeah, I think we could pull the articles from the spreadsheet so that it would be like one by one. Then like for example get like the most recent one, for example all the all the articles scraped for today and then.

Bryan Wolf   1:20:10
Mm-hmm.

Lem   1:20:19
That's the one that we will give to ChatGPT to get the top three, if that makes sense.
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:20:26
Yeah, the problem is it's not gonna be, it's not gonna be summaries, right? It's gonna be whole articles. And then when we send whole articles, that could add up quickly, right? From a from a tokens perspective, we were looking at it.

Bryan Wolf   1:20:27
OK.

Lem   1:20:37
Oh yeah, yeah, that's the Yep, that's the only, yeah, on the so.

Peter Wolf   1:20:41
So Innoreader gives us the summaries.

Lem   1:20:44
On on the spreadsheet, it's like the full article there on the per every per link. OK.

Peter Wolf   1:20:50
Yeah, that's the way I'm doing it. I don't have any summary functionality.

Lem   1:20:56
OK, um.

Peter Wolf   1:20:59
But let's just see what happens if again, what's our, what's our filter when we feed it to ChatGPT? What are we using as the filter to tell it our target market? Were we putting in my persona or whatever? I I think, yeah, that's probably not, that's probably not the best, right? We need to write a specific.

Lem   1:21:00
Yeah.
The persona. Yeah, yeah, the persona is the.

Peter Wolf   1:21:19
Filter. So OK, let me let me just real quick. Let me try something here. Let me uh um.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:20
There's too far where it should be Saturday.

Peter Wolf   1:21:27
If I go to ChatGPT, ChatGPT and.
I say I want to.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:39
Thank you.

Peter Wolf   1:21:40
So hold on a second.
Oh.
Chat, you there?
Hey there. Yeah, I'm here. How can I help you? I want to. I want to create a prompt for you that if I were feeding you a large number of news article summaries, like 30 or 50 words.
And I wanted you to filter through them to pick the, let's say 5 best articles that would match a certain target market's interests. So my my target market is is senior.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:26
I.

Peter Wolf   1:22:30
Treasury, corporate treasury and finance professionals and I am interested specifically in articles that would be incorporating a spin of technology and corporate finance or corporate treasury or banking.
But it has to have a technology spin or be focused on, let's say, Fortune 500 type companies and their success or experience or failures related to technology deployments in the space of finance. Now the articles.
Gonna be pulled from from curated sites that are primarily finance oriented sites to begin with. How would you formulate that to ensure that I would get the best selection of only the most?
Valuable, most interesting, most insightful, most current topics. If I extracted that on a daily basis and fed it to you, a list of let's say 100 articles, and I asked you to get the five best that fit that target market, how would you write that prompt?
Sounds like a fun challenge. Here's a prompt that you could use to get the best articles for your target market. Please review the following summaries of news articles, each about 30 to 50 words long. My goal is to select the top five articles that would be most valuable and insightful for senior corporate, treasury, and finance professionals.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:49
Excellent.

Peter Wolf   1:24:01
The ideal articles should meet the following criteria. One relevance to corporate finance or treasury. The articles should focus on topics related to corporate finance, treasury management, banking or financial strategy. Technological spin. The article should incorporate a technology angle. This could be about fintech innovations, digital.
Transformation, automation, AI and finance, blockchain and banking, or other tech-driven trends impacting corporate finance or treasury and Fortune 500 Focus. The article should idealize stories or lessons learned from Fortune 500 companies, especially regarding their experiences with technology in the finance.
Treasury space insightfulness and current relevance. Prioritize articles that provide unique insights, recent developments, or forward-looking perspectives that would be of interest to senior level professionals. Once you have these summaries, please filter through them using the above criteria and select the top five that best align.
With these interests, you can customize or tweak that prompt depending on any additional specifics you might have in mind. Great. Thanks.

Lem   1:25:08
Yeah, that's good. I think, yeah, I think that would, yeah, we would change the prompting on chat, ChatGPT to a filter one because yeah, on the past the context there is it's getting your persona and choosing like the articles.

Peter Wolf   1:25:15
You're welcome. If you have any other tweet, go ahead.

Lem   1:25:28
From the persona. So yeah, I think we could update that one on that on that like kind of prompt that it should be.

Peter Wolf   1:25:28
Yep, Yep.
Yeah, so here I'm gonna plug it in right now. I'm gonna plug it into the chat.

Lem   1:25:37
Yeah.
I think it would be.
So that like the main filter would be on ChatGPT while it it's also getting the top five, so it's also filtering it out.

Peter Wolf   1:25:53
Right. So here now we would just say, I would just say in this now we would potentially pull out the the the problem. Yeah, so now we would go, we would have this, I would, I would move away from those websites that have firewall, right.

Lem   1:26:11
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:26:11
We'll we'll go through the list of those treasury focused sites that I use for scraping articles to begin with, right? I've already come up with a list. We'll find out which ones are available in a reader and then we will. We'll just tell it to pull a massive amount and we'll just feed them all to to to to ChatGBD.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:21
So you wanted it for your apartment?

Lem   1:26:22
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:27
Uh huh.

Peter Wolf   1:26:31
Have ChatGPT be the filter, right?

Lem   1:26:33
Yep, that's right. Yeah, the ChatGPT would be the one that will filter.

Peter Wolf   1:26:36
And then we don't worry. We already know they're finance sites. We know there's going to be a lot of stuff that's going to be financed, but it's not interested to us. But we will from that, we take that large number and we'll do it on a daily basis. And again, most of these sites only put out.
Five articles a day or something like that and.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:00
Appears.

Peter Wolf   1:27:00
There, here's, there we go. Fortune 500. Yeah, so there's there's the prompt. So let's let's go right now to the to that website we just had.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:07
So there's there's a problem. So let's let's go right now to the.
That website we just had both filter, tell it to pull all the articles that they've had in the next 30 days, see how many that is and then let's feed back to this.

Peter Wolf   1:27:15
With no filter, tell it to pull all the articles that they've had in the last 30 days, see how many that is, and then let's feed that list to Chat GPD with this prompt and see what we get.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:29
Chats, you could do with this bug. See what you get. Yeah, that's fine.

Lem   1:27:33
OK.
Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:38
Yes.

Lem   1:27:47
Can you just clone it first? Yeah, duplicate so that we won't lose the also the.

Peter Wolf   1:27:51
Yeah, destroy it and everything we have.

Lem   1:27:53
Yeah, yeah, the just the the chat ChatGPT note.

Peter Wolf   1:27:56
But we can create a different cluster source, right? You said that before we can create another source cluster on Innoreader or not?

Lem   1:28:05
Um.
On yeah, basically like a new feed is that uh.

Peter Wolf   1:28:11
And a new feed group of feeds.

Lem   1:28:13
Yeah, we could actually do that on, you know, reader, so.

Peter Wolf   1:28:17
Yep. So let's create a new group. I'll go down through my list of websites and you'll put them in and we'll see what we how many of them we can come up with, right? They're non, they're non paywall stuff.

Lem   1:28:29
Yeah, yeah. But what what I mean is the ChatGPT node here. So we could also like duplicate it so that we won't lose the like the original one. Yeah, this one. Yeah, just.
Clone it and just put it at the side. Yep. Then we could copy and paste the prompt, the new prompt on the there. Yep.
For the choosing of top three articles and we would we still use the persona or we could bypass it for now, right? Yeah, we we could bypass it for now. So yeah, we could just.

Peter Wolf   1:29:01
No, no bypass the persona.

Lem   1:29:11
Paste it. Yeah, just all right. Paste the prompt at the on the instructions. So can you see the yeah, from that system up to the instructions?

Peter Wolf   1:29:31
Can't hear you, Brian. Brian.

Lem   1:29:33
Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:29:34
I'm sorry. OK. I'm sorry guys. I haven't been on mute. So you're saying, um, so we want to get rid of the persona. So should I get rid of this and then put it here after this?

Lem   1:29:36
Oh, OK, OK.
Yeah, yeah, the yeah. After the let's try to remove all the.
The one from.

Bryan Wolf   1:29:55
Yeah.

Lem   1:29:58
Above the final output so that this is like a Jason format already, so just uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:04
Tell me where.

Lem   1:30:04
This can you above that one? So there's above the batch input data. So above batch input data. Yeah, that one. Yeah, so just delete. Yeah, everything there and then.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:06
Here to delete everything in here.

Lem   1:30:20
Um.
Yeah, OK. And then oops.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:27
Oh ****.

Lem   1:30:28
Yeah, it's OK. Yeah. So and then above that, can you just add 2 hashtags and then a system so that it will have a context? Yep. And then system all caps.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:36
**** hashtag like that.

Lem   1:30:43
System. Yep. And then just press enter. Yeah, a space enter in the app. OK, I think this is good. So just the oh, right the.
Oh.
Relevance Corporate. So it's actually.
Oh.
The deal articles.
So the 12345 I think is gone, so that's.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:15
What do you mean?

Lem   1:31:15
On the on the no, on the original, on the prompt, the new prompt. So yeah, I know I just go back here. So I'm just finding the this one is the one from the chat, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:31:30
Chat. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe it didn't format it properly. It's in there. Hold on. It's it's in there. It's just it's just not laid out. Like, here's technological spin. Here's Fortune 500, Yes. So it's in there. It's just not laid out. OK.

Lem   1:31:32
Oh, OK, OK, yeah, yeah, it it did format dialect.
Yeah, the tech technological spin. Yep. OK, Yep, Yep.
OK, Yep, I think we could try this one now. So for.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:51
OK, this is for the newsletter, so.
Yeah, Persona.

Lem   1:31:57
Subsection for news. Yeah, OK and this this will just Oh yeah, the get persona. So we would need to unlink this one, the get get the persona so we wouldn't be using.
Yep, this one and then just.
Yeah, OK. And yeah, I think this this should be good.
Mm.
Mm.
Then the filter I mean the can you go to I know reader on the left node on the I know reader module on the left the first one get articles from I know reader and then let's just check if.
The limit.

Bryan Wolf   1:32:52
I'm sorry, I'm bugging. Okay, I don't need her.

Lem   1:32:57
Uh, yeah, that's 30, so it's it's just 30, so.
Yeah, I think we could, we could try it out then check. Yep, just no, no, just that one. I know reader is is. Yeah, we could just run this one just.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:04
Leave it.
I'm gonna run the whole thing, right?
We'll check the data.

Lem   1:33:20
Dying reader one.
Then you could just check the spreadsheet after.
Oh, that was fast.
Uh, yeah, I'm not sure.
Why is it? Is it, uh, 30 bundles, right?
Yeah, but there are only.
The other ones doesn't have summary, I think.
So there are only four.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:09
I'm his. That's just one. So processing the other ones more like working in in Idaho prison.

Lem   1:34:11
Misses.
No, I think it didn't.
Oh, is it just one? So it should be top five.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:22
Thank you.

Lem   1:34:28
Let me go select the top five articles.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:30
And my mom's here. She's downstairs. She's going to pee. I'm in the kitchen. Sorry.

Lem   1:34:33
I think it's on the prompt side.
Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:45
OK.

Lem   1:34:46
5.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:47
No.

Lem   1:34:48
Yeah, it's just one. That's odd. Yep. That's. Yeah, I think.

Bryan Wolf   1:34:49
You're saying in here?
You're saying it has something to do with the proper here?

Lem   1:34:58
My goal is to select the top five articles.
Yeah, there's already the top five articles.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:08
I think we should get rid of this.

Lem   1:35:14
Yeah, I think we could and so that my goal is to set up. I already that would be the most events and I think she has been.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:27
So like this.

Lem   1:35:31
Yeah, I think this would also help. I think so #3.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:35
Those names I'm doing.

Lem   1:35:37
The number 4.
So once you have the summaries, please filter through them using the above criteria and select the top five that best align with this interest. Yeah, this already good I think.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:52
Was it only these four though? Yeah, it was only these four. OK, save. Let's try that again.

Lem   1:35:52
Um.
OK.
Yeah, I think there's no. Can you go back to, can we check the IN reader data? I think it's not the other ones. I don't have summary, I think, yeah. So there are only four who has the summary, so it's.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:08
This one.
Why does it glitch like that when I do that?

Lem   1:36:17
Yeah, the summary.
Um, pardon.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:23
Look, do you see that on my screen how it goes like that? So it's glitching like that.

Lem   1:36:27
Yeah, I think it it's because it's very long, so it's the other one.
Yeah, this is the.
Yes, so it's not getting the summary for other articles. Not sure this is coming from the this INA reader, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:36:46
I believe so. Oh, I would assume so. Yeah, it has to be.

Lem   1:36:51
Oh, OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:53
'Cause that's right, yeah, it's pulling.

Lem   1:36:57
Yes.
I think we could change. Can you change it to 100 the articles so that uh.
Um, let's check it out. Yep, to limit 100 and uh, run it again if it could pull out some other.
How much is that? One? Oh, it's just seven. Yeah, it's just seven, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:37:20
Yeah, 7.

Lem   1:37:25
Oh.
And so the other ones doesn't have summary.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:31
I guess not.

Lem   1:37:40
Yeah, this would be a problem.

Bryan Wolf   1:37:41
OK.

Lem   1:37:44
Mm.
No.
No.
Yeah, now we have 5, right?
Um.
Yeah, I think we could check now on the newsletter.
Spreadsheet.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:39
Well, it doesn't. Oh, on the spreadsheet, will it show up on this?

Lem   1:38:42
Yeah, on the newsletter, yeah, the here and on filter articles. So I think it's on.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:50
I don't know what is it today. Is it today?

Lem   1:38:56
07/03 Yeah, I think this is today.
That's Yep, July 3.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:01
Yeah.

Lem   1:39:05
AI Social Network Steve Jobs.
That's all from Business Insider.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:12
This is inside.

Lem   1:39:15
Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:16
OK, well.

Lem   1:39:21
Mm.
Yeah, their API actually is I think glitching out or something. So it can't pull out the the other like other articles doesn't have a summary, so that's.
Really. Uh, then it's a problem. Morning, Nick.

Nicholas Westburg   1:39:48
Morning, guys.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:51
So, Nick.

Nicholas Westburg   1:39:51
Morning.

Lem   1:39:54
Yeah, but uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:39:55
Yeah, I don't know him.

Nicholas Westburg   1:40:02
Lem, I got your emails. Thanks for that.

Lem   1:40:02
Oh, I see.
OK, no problem.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:06
Balloons.

Lem   1:40:08
Sony sequel to the social network. Steve Jobs legacy isn't just a lot. This dollar is fine. Yeah, the subsection. So I'm just thinking if this is like a finance technology, so not sure if.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:13
Is this what you're looking at?
I don't know culture. I don't think it is.

Lem   1:40:31
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:40:35
For finance leaders, this one shows power. OK, well, that last part includes it.

Lem   1:40:46
Mm.
Yeah, that's.
We're having a problem on the Iner reader side, so it's not picking up all the oh, it's actually, yeah, the other feeds doesn't have like a summary, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:08
This one still.

Lem   1:41:08
1.
Yeah, no, I mean what I mean is on because we have like 100, we picked up 100 articles, right? Yeah, but there are only seven who has the summary. So I'm not sure why it's doing it like that.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:16
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:41:27
Um, but yeah, this should already have the summary because it's like a pro plan already, right? Uh, I reader.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:33
Yeah. Oh, no, I'm not. I'm not. This is not. He's not a pro plan.

Lem   1:41:37
Oh, wow. I think that's why. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah. Um.

Nicholas Westburg   1:41:42
For what?

Lem   1:41:44
OK. I I think we what? Oh, right. It's already pro plan. Yeah, this. Yeah, it's a pro plan. Yeah. So I think we should be.

Bryan Wolf   1:41:45
Oh, no, he is. He is. He is broken. It is. Remember, I did this with you. It is.

Nicholas Westburg   1:41:58
Hey, I don't want to interrupt you. I just, I know I just got here. So for like plans and APIs and stuff, is your dad pay like you? So if you're paying for like a pro plan within make, does that not necessarily mean you have to go out and get different like pay for different plans to get access to like APIs and other features and stuff?

Lem   1:41:59
Yes.
OK, no problem please. Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:17
Well, on Make we have a group plan. Like on Make we have a group plan and then for the rest of them, for the rest of the APIs, we just keep pushing money until when they run out.

Lem   1:42:17
Uh.

Nicholas Westburg   1:42:28
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   1:42:29
Yeah you would need to depending on the platform that you would use. So other ones have like free for example this like Google Sheets. But for example yeah this one I like I know reader RSS feed. So we need to pay for this one and also like the appify. So there's also like credits for.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:38
Mhm.

Nicholas Westburg   1:42:38
Mhm.

Bryan Wolf   1:42:48
Yeah.

Lem   1:42:49
That one, but yeah, but basically if you're using like free platforms, like for example for the database, like Notion has a free plan, so you wouldn't need, you would, yeah, you wouldn't need to pay for other.
Platforms if all are free plans, yeah, basically. But yeah, it would depend on the use case actually, yeah. And the like the free like the pricing free free tiers on that platform.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:07
Mhm.

Lem   1:43:24
But yeah.
Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:30
What do you want to do? Chop it even more?

Lem   1:43:35
Yes, Nope. Because it's already a a pro plan, so that should I think, yeah. And then you tried the summary a while ago. So this I think this is because it didn't update, I think because all were.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:38
Mm.

Lem   1:43:52
Uh, it was not unread. I'm not sure if it was.

Bryan Wolf   1:43:55
Oh, 'cause of the ones you were checking earlier, you say, 'cause we did red on red.

Lem   1:43:57
Yeah, that's right. So I think can can we add the finance? Yeah, so it didn't update in the past. Can you click the finance and economics?
No, the finance and economics folder. And then let's create a rule that would mark. Yeah, create. No, just create rule. So it's a different. Yeah, this one and then.
Yeah, Mark as red. Just uh, put a real name there. Uh, Mark as red.
And then for the this one new article in folder can you oh can you click the add condition? Yeah if on the if add condition.
Yeah, this one. So. And then for this detected language, so at the bottom, can you see the no on the title? Yeah, this one. So the type of line then is English. Yeah. OK, no, it's OK.
It's English, so then add action. So add action at the bottom. Yeah, mark as read. Yep, that's right. So mark as read. Save rule. Yeah. So what will happen here is whenever there's like a new feed, it would automatically add it as unread.
So I think, uh, yeah, it wasn't uh.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:23
Let me try again now.

Lem   1:45:23
Uh was.
4 minutes, 6 minutes. I think we have already have a new yeah, can we? Yeah, let's try it again. And we can actually like unlink it first. Unlink it to ChatGPT so that we could just yeah, we could just check the then let's say we.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:48
Should I keep it 100?

Lem   1:45:51
Yeah, just keep it at 100. So let's check if it would add something there. OK, run anyway.
Right.
Did it? Yeah. So it added, right. Yeah, it added two. Yes, that's, uh, that's good. So.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:03
9.

Lem   1:46:09
Yeah, it added.
Yeah, so it's already updating correctly. Yep, that's good. I think the other ones, the other articles wasn't updated like.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:22
It already marks the most red.

Lem   1:46:26
No, I it it went to the newsfeed when the plan is still on basic. So that's why. Yeah, that's why it doesn't have the like the summary, like the summary function on the article. So.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:32
OK.
For like 90% of the, yeah, it does.

Lem   1:46:42
If that makes sense, yeah. So yeah, starting, yeah, as you can see the bundle one and bundle 2 here has like already this is like a new article, so it already has the summary. So it's that means it's already updating live right now.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:56
So in the future this should work better.

Lem   1:46:57
Yep, that's right. Yes. So in the future we would have for all articles here, we would have like the summary for that particular articles, but Yep.
Uh.
So the summary, yeah, it's different format for for example for this one, it's just like scraping the particular website for that one.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:21
I'm just reading over this.
Have a good time. Have a good couple of days. I'm glad. Team jump too. Then it's not a standard.

Lem   1:47:32
No.
But Yep, I think this is already working fine. So we the thing that we would be we need to refine I think is the yeah the chat, chat, it's choosing the like the right ones.
So.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:54
Oh, funny. Yeah, like that. Yeah, it's crazy, right? Faxing.
It's not to choke it that.

Lem   1:48:08
Technological spin.
How would we test this out I think?
Yeah, to to test it out, we could actually just unlink this one, this, yeah, unlink it and then just run it once so that we could test what is it inputting. So we have nine, right? OK, we have 9.
There's still new no.
Um.
Yep. And then can we check the data of ChatGPT? So here we could actually see on the result. Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:09
I got five. Well, it only has to get 5 actually, so.

Lem   1:49:14
Yeah, five. So yeah, we could now check. So yeah, for example, it's it's just choosing Business Insider, I think mostly Business Insider and.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:17
****, dude.
Yeah, it is. So it is. Spread your business inside, yeah.

Lem   1:49:28
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:29
Uh, why, though? Why Barron's?

Lem   1:49:31
Is this insider?
Yeah, this is from Barron's.

Bryan Wolf   1:49:37
This is.

Lem   1:49:39
When I focus on finances, innovation lessons from tech world session.
Yep. Uh.
Yeah.
Yeah, I think we would need more data to compare it to, so we only have 9.
For the line reader.
So can can you check the get articles from any reader? I just want to check something if Oh yeah, can you click the unread there for up on the upper right side? Just click the red so that it would all be.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:25
You're saying here?
Or inmake.

Lem   1:50:36
Yeah, Mark has read articles so that it would up OK and then.
On the make.com, all right, we didn't add filter there yet, right? So it's.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:49
I think we on here are.

Lem   1:50:52
On the.

Bryan Wolf   1:50:56
On here we did.
Not for the whole thing for.

Lem   1:51:01
Yeah, for the whole thing, I think we just added a filter for.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:07
And then we created a rule.

Lem   1:51:09
Yeah, also the rule, yeah the rule. But I think can we add a filter for AI first because I think it's also pulling out the yeah filter folder and then filter content.
Let me check. So this filter may configure with existing ones. Uh, it's OK Yeah, this is this already on the filter that the AI contains AI.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:35
It's not for. It's not for finance and economics. It's for like one of the specific like financial times and ****. Not all like the whole overarch, because this is for every filter. You know what I mean? This is or this is for we did ours.

Lem   1:51:43
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's for the.

Bryan Wolf   1:51:51
On.
This one and this one, Yeah, so we can do a whole thing.

Lem   1:51:56
On Financial Times, right? Yeah. On. Yeah. And there. Yep, just write. Filter contains. Yeah, we could AI. OK, then just save filter.
Yeah, so that you would. Yeah, I think we added this, but I think it's on your I know reader. I think, yeah, take the rule and also the filters. Yeah, that that's why.

Bryan Wolf   1:52:19
Yeah.
Oh, my one. Yeah, not Peter's. Yeah, it was. It was on mine.

Lem   1:52:25
Still doesn't have.

Bryan Wolf   1:52:28
That's still loading.

Lem   1:52:39
Yeah, because the output for that one would be coming from here. So if we could filter it out here like narrow down the the articles so it would be much better I think.
Yahoo Finance Fortune.
Yeah.
OK, so I think, yeah, it's already filtered out.
Um.
Then.

Bryan Wolf   1:53:24
7.
Bye.

Lem   1:53:25
Yep, I think this is already work. Uh, fine.

Bryan Wolf   1:53:31
Sure on it.

Lem   1:53:32
Um.
Yep, we just need to. Yep, we would need if we could get like a.
For example 50 or like more than 50 articles, that would be good, but for now it's just we can just get 9 right? So the other one still doesn't have like a summary, so we can test it out.

Bryan Wolf   1:53:52
Mhm.

Lem   1:53:56
Uh, life.
Oh, that's good. So it's already. Yeah, it's already catching 60. That's nice.

Bryan Wolf   1:54:02
60. What's it say?

Lem   1:54:05
Yeah, that's right. That's good. So, yeah, that's right. That's OK. Yeah. So it's actually processing like a lot of, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:54:08
Yeah.
Nice.
This is just for AI though.

Lem   1:54:18
Yeah, that all of that I think is already filtered out. So with AI and yeah, let's check out if what what ChatGPT would pick up there.

Bryan Wolf   1:54:22
No.

Lem   1:54:34
Yes, it already pick up 6. Yeah, 60. That's good.
I think this would be, uh yeah, this is a lot of data, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:54:54
Yeah, it's gonna take a little bit. That's OK.

Lem   1:54:55
Yeah, yeah. I hope it doesn't like time out or yeah, really limit because 60, I think. Not sure if, oh, it's good. Yeah. Did it crash out?

Bryan Wolf   1:54:58
Crash out or yeah.
I just won. I think it just did crash out.
I think it did.

Lem   1:55:13
Can you check? Oh, it's OK. Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:55:14
We'll see, actually.
Business Insider.

Lem   1:55:17
Uh, this is insider. Can we check the?

Bryan Wolf   1:55:20
Are these the same ones? This is insider.

Lem   1:55:22
Uh, I guess utilities are beginning to.

Bryan Wolf   1:55:25
Business inside me.

Lem   1:55:28
That's getting only for Business Insider.

Bryan Wolf   1:55:29
Why only business and fortune? That's not the fortune. Maybe business and service are the best one.

Lem   1:55:32
This from fortune we must repair AI needed to shape the feature of work as only. But yeah, I not true. Yeah why it's just choosing it has a bias on Business Insider. So that's really odd.

Bryan Wolf   1:55:45
Maybe we have to add to the prompt. Don't exclude just businesses are.

Lem   1:55:49
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:56:00
Oh yeah, baby.

Lem   1:56:06
Yeah, this batch input data is really, I think, very long for what's next for this empire.

Bryan Wolf   1:56:11
Too much, yeah.
Well, look at this. This is talking about Sean Levy Combs. Yeah, this is a lot of information. That's why I can't do this much every time, cause this punch is chewing our our money up for a thing, no doubt. Just chewing it on.

Lem   1:56:19
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. So, uh, it's it.
Yeah, it's better if we could narrow down the like the websites on Inoreader. Yeah, on the search so that maybe we could feed ChatGPT like 10 to 20, but like already already narrowed down list.

Bryan Wolf   1:56:31
Yeah.
Search here.
Yeah.
Not 60, yeah.

Lem   1:56:47
Yeah, 60 is quite long, so it would like actually can see the in the output. So can you put that below below on the token usage. So let's check the usage. Yeah. Oh my God, so the prompt. Yeah, this is 147,000.

Bryan Wolf   1:56:48
It's a lot, yeah.
Yeah, not great, dude. Not great. I so it's not.

Lem   1:57:08
So yeah, this is this is just one run, so it's like costing.

Bryan Wolf   1:57:11
I know it's not. I don't want to keep doing it, you know?

Lem   1:57:14
Yeah, like $0.05 I think, or seven cents something.

Bryan Wolf   1:57:19
And I'll have to look at alternatives.

Lem   1:57:20
Yeah, almost a dollar, I think for yeah, because this is 4.1.

Bryan Wolf   1:57:25
Oh, that's great. Nice. Awesome. Nice. No, but.

Lem   1:57:28
Yeah, I think we could just, yeah, narrow it down for I know reader on the I know reader side because this won't, yeah, this would churn out the a lot of credits.

Bryan Wolf   1:57:34
Mhm.
Yeah, and you.
Well, I'm gonna work on this a little bit and then try and make some new rules and new filters. Maybe add a couple here.

Lem   1:57:41
Yep, I think, yeah, Yahoo Finance, we could, yeah, like an add and add or maybe like add like add a filter on like each of them I think.

Bryan Wolf   1:57:56
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. And I'm also gonna try and add a couple more, uh, sources as well.

Lem   1:58:00
Yeah, then.
Because, yeah, on the filter side, I think we could add like or also there, yeah, artificial intelligence or AI or something. So, so that we could narrow it down. But yeah, but I think that's good.

Bryan Wolf   1:58:08
Yeah, instead of and instead of and. Yeah, OK.
Yeah, yeah, alright.
I got another call at at 11, but I think this is good. I'm I'm glad we got the work project stuff, work project stuff. But yeah, I mean, I don't know. I don't. I don't know if Peter's gonna send any stuff like today, but.

Lem   1:58:21
OK, Yep. Yeah. I also have a yeah.
OK, no problem.
OK, I'll just wait also for his. Maybe he'll message me later or tomorrow for yeah, on Upwork or something.

Bryan Wolf   1:58:34
Whatever.
Yeah, yeah, I think later, later, later, I'll mention too. But we're we're not working tomorrow. Well, I I think he might be working tomorrow, but I don't know. But yeah, so I'll do it again. All right, love. Sounds good. You're the man. Hey, have a good night. Good. Good night's sleep. All right, love.

Lem   1:58:45
OK, OK.
OK.
Thanks. Yeah, you too, guys. Have a good one.

Bryan Wolf   1:58:55
Good night's sleep. I'll talk to you on Monday, alright?

Lem   1:58:58
Yeah, talk to you guys soon.

Bryan Wolf   1:58:59
Yeah, Nick, are you? Nick, are you joining?

Lem   1:59:01
