Lem   0:41
Hello. Hi guys.

Peter Wolf   1:56
Hey, Lem.

Lem   1:58
Hi, Peter. Hi, guys.

Peter Wolf Jr   2:00
Hey, love.
Hello.

Lem   2:08
Yeah, so have you guys received my e-mail? I sent you the like new loom videos and also the.

Peter Wolf   2:17
I I saw it. I haven't opened it up, but I did see you. You sent it, so we definitely received it. Hold on a second. I'm pulling in Bart here too.

Lem   2:20
Yep. OK.
Yeah, so.

Peter Wolf   2:28
Ryan's liking.

Lem   2:29
Yeah, I I also created a spreadsheet so that we could easily like track all of the flows with the. So yeah.

Peter Wolf Jr   2:34
Save it.

Peter Wolf   2:34
Yeah, that's great.
Yep.
All right. I see Brian and Bart are both on as well. So let's let's kind of talk where we are yesterday after the after I dropped off the call, you guys downloaded the.
Prompts or when you downloaded the prompts and from from the different flow or from the web and from the was the LinkedIn post flow and the newsletter flow. Yep, Yep. And so then.

Lem   3:04
Yep.

Bartosz Borek   3:05
Yeah.
All the newsletter. All the yeah, all the newsletter flows. Yeah, everything for the newsletter, so.

Lem   3:13
Yeah, the newsletter. That's right.

Peter Wolf   3:20
Bart and worked with Bryan and looked at kind of Inno reader and see if they could come up with good feeds for articles and they really didn't find anything quality and I think we weren't finding the kind of quality and volume that we were looking for. And then I think they sent you a note about that.
But then when I was driving down to to the house this morning or last night, I was talking through it with ChatGPT and it identified that Innerreader can set up or we can use Innerreader with any feed that has an R or any any source that has an RSS.
Even if we go there and it's not listed as a source, you can set it up as a custom source and still use the filters and whatnot. So I just raised that up to Bart this morning. What we need to do is go to and Bart, I would appreciate if you could drive this given that we were working all those sites for the scraper.

Lem   4:00
Yeah.
OK.

Bartosz Borek   4:16
Yeah, mhm.

Peter Wolf   4:19
Go to those sites where we were previously saying we wanted to pull the articles. Exactly what we were going to do, right? Pull articles to use and everyone that has an RSS feed. Then we should just create our own custom RSS feed and really refine and curate our own list of sources.
On Inno reader to to get the content hopefully that we that we can, I mean that we want. Then additionally if I look at yesterday I had asked for some additional.
Sources that.
Hold on, see where I.
I have trouble finding it quickly here. Yeah, it's now set. Um.
Hold on.
Chad, tell me list out the sources again that you said that I should consider as alternatives for getting articles that we've discussed in this in this chat here. Just list them. Don't give me details, just layout list out the the additional.
Sources that you thought might be good.
Sure. Here are the sources I mentioned. Bloomberg Technology, Reuters Tech News, CNBC Fintech section, Chris Skinner's blog, Fintech OS's blog, 6 Leader rights on Fintech Futures. These should give you a nice variety of Fintech and technology focused content.

Lem   5:47
OK.

Peter Wolf   6:00
So the only problem with that, and I brought this up in the when I was in the chat, the the blogs, I don't. That's not gonna work, although these are really renowned bloggers in the finance and technology space. So I wonder if we shouldn't.
Maybe consider looking at them.
Because again, that guy Skinner, he's really well known. There was a list of them that I actually had had pulled together a while back, but I didn't really think about things. I thought blogs really aren't articles, right? But maybe if it's someone who's a really a trusted source like that and they're writing a blog on something, maybe that is something we would consider to put in that.

Lem   6:28
OK.

Peter Wolf   6:42
Upper section as opposed to, say, social media or something. Barb, what do you think of that?

Bartosz Borek   6:53
I'm not. The thing I worry is that the thing. Can you hear me right?

Peter Wolf   6:53
We lose part.
Yeah, I can hear you now.

Lem   7:00
Yep.

Bartosz Borek   7:01
OK, the thing that I'm worried about is that if we kind of take like someone's personal blog without asking them, I I don't know if that kind of is alright, it seems kind of strange.

Lem   7:05
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   7:15
No, I don't. I would. I don't have any issue with that whatsoever because all we're doing is linking to it, right? We're drawing them more attention to them. I don't think anybody's going to complain about that. It's like we're we're raising visibility and commenting on their stuff, which is obviously what they're blogging about, right? They're blogging to gain attention and visibility and make a statement that they want to get out there. So I don't, I don't see any.

Bartosz Borek   7:16
You don't think so?
OK, yeah.
OK. All right.

Peter Wolf   7:35
Issue with that. I'm just wondering what you think about curating them with articles. I mean, again, these are people that are considered considered kind of leaders in the space.
Maybe we should go look at what their content looks like and yeah.

Bartosz Borek   7:47
Yeah, yeah, of course. I mean In my e-mail.
Yeah. So In my e-mail yesterday, I kind of pointed to the fact that we were talking about it with Brian. And like, if we look at our target, I mean, this all started with the Reddit conversation. I was asking why we're using Reddit as a source, because when I look at Reddit and I look for anything related to corporate treasury or fintech, there's really not much.

Peter Wolf   8:03
Yeah.
Right.
No, I agree. It's more tech stuff for the most part in our in this space. It's definitely not, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   8:11
It's all kind of there's not even like a separate group, group channel. It's more like a I it's definitely it's it's really good for a I apparently. But The thing is like for a I our target market like our target customer like I don't think they're gonna be that interested.

Peter Wolf   8:19
Not finance screen.

Bartosz Borek   8:31
To hearing like that, oh, this new LLM is now four times exactly. So we we need really, really basic, basic AI stuff. Really, really basic AI stuff.

Peter Wolf   8:32
No, it's too technical. It's too technical for them, yes.

Lem   8:36
OK.

Peter Wolf   8:41
And that's why I think that's not a good source, right. But when we try, we were trying, we were trying X, but the whole thing was a cost issue. It was, it was a few $100 a month for us to be able to or even maybe it was thousand or something for us to be able to scrape articles from there or yeah, post from there, so.

Bartosz Borek   8:44
Yeah, yeah, so.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I don't, I don't even think, I don't. I think we would come up come across like the same issue there because I mean I use XA lot for just kind of like you know, personal investing, financial news and the stuff there is incredible. However, if you're not like savvy In whatever field you're looking at, then it's just gonna totally just look at it.
Like a foreign language to you. So I think we need kind of like really basic AI news, like, hey, this was released, this is what this means. So if people are talking about, oh, if have you heard about Graph 4, this is what it actually is. Because The thing is, is that like.

Peter Wolf   9:20
Yep.
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   9:35
I feel like at if you go to an organization, you might hear some of the younger guys like, you know, maybe fresh out of college talking about the A I stuff. But the decision makers are going to hear this and they're going to be like, what the hell are these guys talking about? So this is kind of like, I think curating like a what's new In A I for dummies type of conversation.

Peter Wolf   9:55
Yeah, but I I think it and I think that goes in more in the IT goes more in the in the social media space I think or down in the tool space, but not the article space. Again, I I think it fits what you're talking about and and what we've said from the beginning was we're really looking for kind of meaningful.

Bartosz Borek   9:55
You know what I mean? Because, I mean, Peter, we we talk about this all the time.
Well.

Peter Wolf   10:15
Articles that are the the intersection between finance and technology and A I obviously being the biggest technology discussion now, but really technology in general and and yeah I I think authoritative sources we can check out. I think we should check out the blogs of the of that guy Skinner.

Bartosz Borek   10:20
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   10:34
And I'll look up some other names and just see what their blogs look like, right? Do they come across like articles? Is it? Does it look like good content? Because he specifically, I think the guy Skinner is, is that combination, right? He's finance and technology, so it may be a good source.

Bartosz Borek   10:49
Mm-hmm.

Peter Wolf   10:51
For us to consider. All right, so listen, I have to be at a.

Bartosz Borek   10:54
OK. Yeah, I'll I'll have to go through this, yeah.

Peter Wolf   10:57
OK, yeah, if you could do two things. If you could maybe do a a search on kind of finance and technology bloggers and check out some of them and see if they look like they'd be good. And then if we can go through the list of of websites that we were scraping to begin with. And now that I think about it, wow, I wish I really understood RSSP.

Bartosz Borek   11:04
Mm-hmm.

Peter Wolf   11:16
A long time ago, because we could have gone straight to that instead of instead of building that whole scraper thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But let's let's then curate our own, our own list, right? Because again, we were intending for those to be the source for us to be scraping to begin with. So it makes sense they would be the source.

Bartosz Borek   11:23
Creating a web scraper.
Yeah, OK, so.

Peter Wolf   11:37
We would expect to find decent content for the articles, right?
So then.

Bartosz Borek   11:42
Yeah, we started going through, uh, different content yesterday, Brian and I. So uh, you know, we're looking for other sources for kind of corporate treasury stuff, so.

Lem   11:46
OK.

Peter Wolf   11:52
Right now we're specifically looking to see, do they have an RSS SB, right? Yeah. OK. So then, yeah, go ahead, go.

Bartosz Borek   11:53
Feeds with stuff with RSS feeds. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. So just, you know.
Another thing, the the most beneficial kind of material that we found was actually in those like Deloitte or PWC surveys.

Peter Wolf   12:11
I I'm fine with calling those things out. Like I I I don't mind. I don't feel like I'm sending them to the competition cause I don't even though we do directly compete with them. But I don't feel like the the survey stuff is pointing to them being our competition. I I feel like they're it's a different.

Bartosz Borek   12:12
I just.
OK.

Peter Wolf   12:29
I don't know. I I feel like it's different. I don't feel like I'm sending them to their consulting website and saying, hey, use these guys as consultants. Although I guess if I stood back, I should be thinking of it that way. But I I think of those, those surveys, which we've seen before, really good, right? We pull good information from those things.

Bartosz Borek   12:45
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   12:47
I think they're worth calling out and so maybe we shouldn't be. We should be thinking about.

Bartosz Borek   12:51
OK.

Peter Wolf   12:55
Because I would think they could go up in that article section as well, right? But they aren't articles and really we'd have to go out and curate ourselves, find those and then place them into that into that spreadsheet to to add them, right, which we do have the ability to do manually.
But if it's not really an article, I guess there must be somewhere the URL must give an overview of here's a survey or something like we we should try and see what happens when we do that because we already have some of those, right? If we go find one of the links to one of the surveys we we we pulled before Bart that we put into that folder.

Bartosz Borek   13:14
Mm-hmm.

Peter Wolf   13:32
If we if you work with Bryan and try to plug one of those URLs in and see what happens when we try and process it like it's an article.

Bartosz Borek   13:32
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   13:44
Right. Because the spreadsheet, if we find an article we're interested in, we can plug that in manually into the into the spreadsheet, click the button and it will treat it like it was fed in. At least that's my recollection. Kind of like what we said with the tools. With the tools we can do that. I think we can do that with the articles as well, but I think that survey.

Bartosz Borek   13:45
OK.

Peter Wolf   14:04
Everything is great. That's a that's a freaking terrific one to bring to people's visibility, right? And they come out, you know, they come out on a regular basis from all those big names, PWC, Deloitte, Accenture, whatever.

Bartosz Borek   14:07
Yeah.
Yeah, Yep.
Yeah. So we would just have to add them. We would just have to add them manually and see if, uh, if see that, see if that works. So I think that's fine.

Peter Wolf   14:23
See what's and if it if it doesn't work, then we need to modify. We need to modify to to allow that to be able to enter them manually like that.

Bartosz Borek   14:33
Yeah, OK.

Peter Wolf   14:34
OK, so so then if you guys can work on that, if you can then Lem, you were gonna work on the connection for for directly from.
Geez, man, I'm having trouble speaking directly from the ChatGPT, right?

Lem   14:50
The.

Bryan Wolf   14:52
I think I.

Lem   14:55
Yeah, it's, yeah, it's already done the like the integration on the custom GPT. So I also, yeah, I also explained it on the loom video and I also tested it there. So Yep.

Peter Wolf   15:02
OK.

Bryan Wolf   15:07
Mm.

Peter Wolf   15:08
OK, good. If you can then walk Bryan through getting that set up, Bryan, so you can get it set up onto my ChatGPT and then yeah, because what we said, what I discussed with with Lem was it's essentially setting up for the same structure as what we have for this contact database.

Bryan Wolf   15:09
Great.

Lem   15:13
OK.

Bryan Wolf   15:17
Yeah, sure.

Peter Wolf   15:26
That model will still work, right? Because what we're talking about is the input in the contact database. Ultimately, we said we're going to build an iPhone app that would allow me to talk, that would connect directly into the make, and then it would store the information. It would go to the brain, right? The Agentic AI hub inside make.

Lem   15:31
Oh.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   15:46
And figure out which path it goes to A to a Google sheet or Google Doc. And then if we're retrieving it, we retrieve the info again, feed it into into the standard API ChatGPT to filter it down. So we don't send as many tokens or use as many tokens, then it would send it back to the app to me, right? So right now we're just doing the.

Lem   16:02
Yep, that's right.
Yes, that's right.

Peter Wolf   16:06
Same thing. We're using ChatGPT as essentially the app interface because there's other stuff that I work on. For example, the flows where I'm having a conversation with ChatGPT and saying, OK, where are we on the flows? Here's the list of flows. Well, I really want that to go and update a spreadsheet.

Lem   16:11
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   16:23
And so we this is the same mechanism, same methodology, it's just going to go to a different document. Now what I don't understand or I'm not I'm unclear on and we'll have to work with Lemon is if I have multiple documents, do I need to make different different connections or can it all be one connection and it's in that Agentec AI?

Lem   16:30
Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   16:42
Brain where we say, Oh well, if I talk about a contact, then it should go to the contact document or the contact Google sheet. And if I talk about process flows, it should go to the process flow Google sheet. And that's what we would put in the agentic brain, right?

Lem   16:49
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's uh.
Yep, that's right. Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   16:58
OK. So I think we need to, we need to play around with that and think about that. But Bryan, I'd like you to get that set up for my account so that we can, yeah, that we can start drilling into that and seeing how we expand that out so that it could go to multiple sources. To me, that's exactly what the agentic.

Lem   17:06
No.

Bryan Wolf   17:09
Yeah.
Oh.

Peter Wolf   17:17
Process, the kind of core brain thing we're talking about. That's what everybody's saying is about Agentic. You know, is it making the decision? Where do I go? Where do I route? We're not writing a unique process flow for each one of them. We're saying you come into this hub and give the hub guidance, give the Agentic AI guidance on how it should.
How it should manage things and then it does the routing appropriately after that, right?

Lem   17:42
Yep, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   17:43
Mm.

Peter Wolf   17:43
OK, so I I apologize. I got to jump off. I have to go to the bank and take care of some stuff. So if you guys can work on that and figure out however you guys are going to use the time, I apologize. Yeah, that I'm not able to to work further on this, OK.

Lem   17:50
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   17:59
All right, guys. Thanks. Talk to you. Bye.

Lem   17:59
OK, Peter, no problem. Yep.

Bartosz Borek   18:00
Yep, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   18:01
Yeah.

Lem   18:05
OK, um, yeah, let me.
Share my screen first.
Yes, so I need to send you Bryan. I need to send you like the new what you call this one new Jason files because I've actually updated this one and then.

Bryan Wolf   18:23
Yeah.

Lem   18:33
So these are like all updated.
So I'll send you the Jason files and all for the like the spreadsheet.

Bryan Wolf   18:39
OK.

Lem   18:51
I think you already have. Yeah, it's also on our like the documentation spreadsheet. So it's actually also there, but let me just export this.

Bryan Wolf   18:59
OK.

Lem   19:05
Uh, Jason first.
Uh.
Yeah, because I like I've updated lot of things here, like for example the variables and the descriptions. So it would be like a different.
Different from the one that I've sent you.

Bryan Wolf   19:36
Excuse me. Hey, wait, so.
OK, alright, if you'd send me, that would be great. But uh, Bart, so.

Lem   19:42
Yeah. So we connected it. Oh, OK.

Bryan Wolf   19:46
Oh, sorry, I'm sorry. I just wanted to ask about the RSS feed. So Bart did. I didn't really catch what he said about um.

Lem   19:50
Oh.

Bartosz Borek   19:54
So I'm gonna, I'm gonna research that and then.

Bryan Wolf   19:55
Adding other sources to Unarina. Yeah, I just looked it up right now. It says that you can just add it in. Yeah, we can just add whatever you want. I'm looking on check your team. It says that, but I don't know if you already know how to do that or not, but yeah.

Bartosz Borek   19:58
Yeah, apparently we can add other sources.
OK.
I OK, So what I'll do is I'll send you guys an e-mail with the list of sources that we want added and I'll kind of comment in there if it has an RSS feed or if it doesn't and I guess we can try both. And then also I'm going to try to send you the links to the surveys which will have to be manually.

Bryan Wolf   20:17
Yeah.
OK.

Bartosz Borek   20:29
So I will. I'll spell it. I'll spell it out in the e-mail because I know it's like we're working. There's a lot of moving parts here, so that'll be the easiest way. And then Len, by the way, I looked at your. I looked at the scripts that you wrote yesterday and I responded to the e-mail and.

Bryan Wolf   20:30
Yeah.
Great.
Yeah.

Lem   20:45
OK.

Bartosz Borek   20:46
Look, I thought your prompts were really good. I they're very clean. I think they're they're are you are you a coder developer? Is that your background or?

Lem   20:52
Yeah, yeah. Basically, I'm not really on the coding side, but yeah, there are some, yeah, like Jason codes there. Yep.

Bartosz Borek   20:56
Yeah, because it was.
That was it was kind of written in that.
OK, yeah, it was written in that type of language, so I figured you were there. So it was it was very clean. So look, my only not that concern, but.

Lem   21:05
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   21:17
A lot has to do with that persona, right? So that persona, that separate persona is gonna really drive a lot of. And I mean, when we quickly took a look at Brian, it was your persona we looked at yesterday, right?

Lem   21:21
Yep, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   21:32
Yeah, but it's basically Pete's. It's it's it's the same thing. It's really the same thing. Mine's just a little bit more tweaked. If anything, Peter's is better than mine, you know?

Bartosz Borek   21:32
It was yours. Or was it like a version of Peter's persona? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   21:41
I I just took. I just took more out. Yeah, there's a lot for sure.

Bartosz Borek   21:42
There was a lot of stuff in there, like there was.

Bryan Wolf   21:51
Yeah.
Almost too much.

Bartosz Borek   21:57
Problem when we load 'cause 'cause it's like too much that it might like confuse the system. What's your opinion on that, Len?

Lem   22:07
On the yeah that that's right that that's actually what I was also like worried about because the like when I saw the the like the persona of like Bryan sent me actually like the edited persona that is that was Peter's and.

Bartosz Borek   22:07
And you could be honest here.
On the persona if.

Lem   22:27
We just edited some of the parts so I I it was kinda long and then like the the content that we are building is actually like a just like a gist, right? Like like just a blurb for the news articles. So yeah, that that was.

Bartosz Borek   22:40
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   22:42
OK.

Lem   22:44
My concern is that maybe it would like get confused or something on like the what to like what to produce. So that's why I've actually suggested on Peter that he he would just like like ask Claude for like the content and then he could.
Feed his persona there and something and then whenever he already gets like the the result that he wants, we would just feed that to like for example Claude or chat GPD for the content so that it would input the same.
Format as that one because for example like the newsletter. I was also not clear on what he wanted because yes yesterday he said that he wanted to have here like.
The like an angle that is coming from like an angle that is coming from Peter, right? Like something like that. So I'm I didn't have that like how did he say it like.

Bryan Wolf   23:47
What do you mean?

Lem   23:53
For example, like how this particular article is giving value to like the treasury target market, something like that. So whenever we add like the I'm not sure if if we add the whole persona like the long list of persona.

Bryan Wolf   24:01
Yeah, mm-hmm.

Lem   24:10
If it would actually input that, yeah, because, yeah, because, because.

Bartosz Borek   24:10
Yeah, definitely not. Definitely not. So see here. So In this case, sorry, sorry, let me just we have to make it as easy as possible. So it has to be, hey, In three sentences.

Bryan Wolf   24:14
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   24:20
Yeah, yeah. Because, yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. It it should be very specific, right. For the AAA models, the instruction should be very specific, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   24:27
Yeah, In exactly in.
Exactly. So the the thing should be like In three or four sentences, how is this relevant to a corporate treasury manager and just see what kind of content it spits out. It has to be really specific like because with, yeah, yeah, so we have to think about.

Lem   24:33
Yeah.
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   24:39
Sorry.

Lem   24:41
Yeah, something like, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
Yeah, that yeah, that was also my concern actually. Because for example, I think there's no problem if like we're creating like a whole blog for example, like a whole content of blog. So that would be like a added context, but if here it's like a different.

Bartosz Borek   24:50
Like the persona.
Yeah, good.
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

Lem   25:05
Content, right? Like it's just like some insight. So I think the much better way to do that is like giving it like a sample as as you've said, like the prompt should be like three to four sentences and then put an angle or something and then.

Bartosz Borek   25:21
Yeah.

Lem   25:22
Maybe feed it also like a sample sample blurbs so that it would have some idea on what to spit out. And then yeah, so that that's actually what I was thinking also because yeah, basically actually.

Bryan Wolf   25:29
Mhm.

Lem   25:39
Also in the past part, I didn't have like context on like the because Peter has like the like the overall vision here, right? So I was actually just inputting like just summary something. So as you can see on my prompts, it was just like generic, right? Like generic summary for here then yeah, so I.

Bartosz Borek   25:56
OK.

Bryan Wolf   25:57
Yeah.

Lem   25:59
I was just building first the like the whole system and then actually it's already done the like the whole system is done. So now it's just the like the content we need to like of course that's the most important part, right? Like the the content that is being being inputted here.
So yeah, I think, yeah, we could. That would be on the prompt side and also on the like the the source of the data like the RSS feed and something. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   26:27
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   26:29
OK, so do you want me to give you like an overarching, like an overarching prompt we can use for for these summary type things or?

Lem   26:32
Um.
Yeah that that would actually help like for like for example this one because yeah I I I'm not sure if what kind of tone or angle like you guys want to also to input here. So if you could give me some prompt and then I could just.

Bartosz Borek   26:46
OK, yeah.

Lem   26:58
Add it to like ChatGPT and then like maybe like fix like the formatting or something because I'm not sure if let me just think but yeah I think I would just copy paste your prompt on the creation here.
And because we have like a different AI model actually for the formatting, so that's not a problem. But yeah, I think that would really help on the like the content as I let me just pull up also the because.

Bartosz Borek   27:27
OK.

Lem   27:32
Uh um on the on our.
Prompts, right? Uh, let me just go to the. Oh, right, it's different. It's.
Here on my drive.
Uh.
No.
Let me just pull out the prompts, so.
Yeah, this one. So as you can see, uh, we have like.

Bartosz Borek   28:07
Lem, did Lem, do you only you? Yeah. OK. Yeah. Go ahead. Sorry.

Lem   28:11
Yeah we we have like 2 models right like for the content and also the other one is just for like research. So I think it would be really helpful if you could like add some like data here on the like the tone or something because.
As you can see here, uh, I just added um, let me just yeah, the instructions is just um.
Select three articles and then provide 50 word. I mean this is like the choosing the articles, but the one that is creating the content is this one. For example this one. The instruction is your task is to write a short newsletter section, so it's just.

Bryan Wolf   28:54
Lem, Lem, you're you're cutting out a ton for me. I don't know if anyone else is getting that feedback, but I I didn't really catch a lot of what you just said. You're you're cutting out for me.

Lem   28:55
Um.
Oh.
Oh uh.

Bartosz Borek   29:03
I I I caught it. Might be a might be a no, I got you. I got you. So I'll go through. Yeah, I'll go through the content. So, so Brian, we just have to go through the content. I'll start doing this and any anytime we need it asks for like a summary we're gonna give, we're gonna give it like for a perspective.

Lem   29:07
OK, OK.
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   29:22
Like a perspective prompt. So I'll put a summary In the In the tone of why this could be, you know, beneficial for you know, we'll I'll think of something and then I'll uh.

Lem   29:23
Yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah.
Yep, I and I think mostly on the content like the like the main instruction is here on the instructions also. So I'm not sure because basically there are different ways to like prompt the AI, right? So I just make it as like this one like a markdown.

Bryan Wolf   29:32
OK.

Bartosz Borek   29:40
Mhm.

Lem   29:47
Markdown uh format with instructions, input data, something like that. So um but but on my.

Bartosz Borek   29:54
So anywhere I see, anywhere I see the hashtag instructions, I have to. OK, I'll, I'll go and I'll. Do you want me to make edits to it or do you want me to just add something to it In a different color and then send it back to you? How about I do that? I'll do it In the version you sent me yesterday.

Lem   29:56
Instructions. Yep.
Yep, that's right. Yeah, so.
No.
Yep, Yep, Yep, yeah. Because I think you could just duplicate this one because this is just like a view link since this is like year on our documentation. So you could just I think duplicate and then so that you could edit.

Bartosz Borek   30:11
OK, perfect.

Bryan Wolf   30:23
OK, yeah.

Lem   30:27
And then I'll also take a look at it and base it on the. Yeah, if that makes sense. But yeah, I think just for example this one just ignore like the like the coding something here. So this is just for the output thing. Yeah, but yeah, basically most of the needs editing is here on the instruction.

Bartosz Borek   30:31
OK.
Yeah.

Lem   30:47
Sections like write short newsletter sections. So this is just very generic. So I don't this doesn't have like the tone of voice, like the angle, something like that. So Yep, OK, that's I think that's it for that one.
Because it's, yeah, it's really hard also for me to for the content because I'm not like a treasury something. So I I'm not really sure on how how to prompt the like the content, but yeah, that would be really help.

Bartosz Borek   31:05
OK.
Yeah, yeah, for sure. Don't worry about it. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   31:12
Yeah, mm-hmm.

Bartosz Borek   31:16
That's the thing. Almost, almost nobody is. That's why it's so hard to. That's why it's, you know, this stuff does not exist. So we almost have to create it all from scratch. So, OK, so I'll do that and now, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   31:16
Yeah.

Lem   31:23
Yeah, yeah, there's a.
Yeah.
Yep.
Yeah, like iterate, uh, task less or something like that. OK.

Bartosz Borek   31:34
I'll also send over. I'll also send over, um, and I'll just direct the e-mail to everybody. Uh, I'll probably respond to the e-mail that I wrote yesterday. I'll also give the uh, the new sources that we wanna use. So then Brian, you could take it from there. So I'll make edits.

Lem   31:44
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   31:47
I got cool. Yeah, yeah.

Lem   31:49
OK.

Bryan Wolf   31:56
Awesome. Yeah.

Lem   31:56
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   32:02
Yeah.

Bartosz Borek   32:02
If we could take it how how that works from there. So yeah, OK, perfect.

Lem   32:03
I am.

Bryan Wolf   32:03
See if we can get them implemented In there. Yeah, alright.

Lem   32:08
Yep. OK, Bart, thanks.

Bartosz Borek   32:10
All right, guys. All right. Thank you. Bye.

Bryan Wolf   32:13
You, Bart.
All right, let me just, uh, upload this stuff real quick and down.

Lem   32:18
OK.
Yeah, have I? Oh, I I already sent it, right? I'm not sure if I. Oh, OK, OK, yeah, yeah, I already sent. And also the prompt, the whole prompt. Yeah, yeah, I think what needs editing here is only just the description for like the Jason files because.

Bryan Wolf   32:28
Yeah, yeah, I just gotta. I just gotta.

Lem   32:41
It doesn't pass on after the. All right, I should've just.

Bryan Wolf   32:48
Or wait, wait, which?

Lem   32:50
Uh, yeah, let me.

Bryan Wolf   32:50
You're talking about, you're talking about In the.

Lem   32:54
Nope. On. Oh, right, right, right. Yeah. On the agent, right. On the tools we have like the description here. So yeah, this is not actually. Yeah, it's not adding on the Jason file, so.

Bryan Wolf   32:54
You're talking about In the AEI agent problems? Yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Is that what you're talking about? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's OK. Oh, ****. My air pod channel.
One second.

Lem   33:12
Um, yeah. So I think I'll just.

Bryan Wolf   33:14
Hold on, I'm sorry.

Lem   33:16
Copy this.
Yeah, it would be much easier, I think to.
Let me just.

Bryan Wolf   33:31
That moves.
Yeah.

Lem   33:35
Excuse me, excuse me.

Bryan Wolf   33:36
No.
God bless you, Rob.

Lem   33:40
Yeah, I'll just send you also like the description of the tools so that you could just copy paste them.

Bryan Wolf   33:48
What do you mean the description? Hold on, 'cause I'm I'm I don't have my I don't have two monitors. I don't have my laptop, so I can't really see while you're I'm doing this. What are you saying though? Let me say.

Lem   33:54
Uh uh yeah, the descriptions here on the particular tools.

Bryan Wolf   34:01
Oh, OK.

Lem   34:03
Uh, excuse me. Oh, think I'm catching a hold.

Bryan Wolf   34:04
OK.
Lem, Lem, don't get sick on me, Lem. Don't get sick on me.

Lem   34:10
Yeah, yeah the the this one, so the tools description. So this is actually adding more also a context to the AA agent. So I'll just copy it and.

Bryan Wolf   34:13
We need you then.
Mhm.
Mhm.

Lem   34:26
Send it to you also so that.
You could.
And then task 2.
Last string.

Bryan Wolf   34:52
Now this custom GPT interface. What is this? This is this is the scanner file.

Lem   34:58
E on the.

Bryan Wolf   35:00
Is it the same one? Yeah, it's. I know, I know, I know. OK, so now let me do this.

Lem   35:04
Yeah, I think that's the, yeah, the the schema. That's right, Task 4.
Yes.
Nice.
5.

Bryan Wolf   35:28
You want me to do this?

Lem   35:31
OK.
OK, I think that's good.
Um.
Yes.

Bryan Wolf   35:57
Wrong.

Lem   35:58
OK, uh, you could also.

Bryan Wolf   35:59
This is the this is this is the record retrieval flow.

Lem   36:02
The Yeah, that's right. The AI agent record retrieval. Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   36:14
Just pull it.

Lem   36:14
Uh.
I.

Bryan Wolf   36:21
OK, I'm gonna put these all In here.

Lem   36:27
OK, you could also share your screen so that I could also check like the.
Um, output. Uh, I mean, yeah, the.
I'll put so let me just.
Record. So these this was the old one, right? Yeah, the old ones, OK.

Bryan Wolf   36:48
It's the old ones, yeah.

Lem   37:06
I did the.

Bryan Wolf   37:08
See, I don't even have his.
Um.

Lem   37:14
The oh right for for the spreadsheet. I think you could just duplicate my spreadsheet because it's actually has his all it. Yeah, it includes all of his contacts I think so.

Bryan Wolf   37:15
Actual database In here.

Lem   37:30
You could just, uh, duplicate that one and then.

Bryan Wolf   37:35
Oh ****, this is so annoying.

Lem   37:36
Just update. Oh, what's?

Bryan Wolf   37:40
This is I have a problem with this. This is I guess.

Lem   37:41
Mhm.
This is on Chrome, right?

Bryan Wolf   37:47
Yeah, it's dude. Google sucks, dude, huh? They they wanna **** me over every chance I get.

Lem   37:47
Yeah, Google is really like, yeah, Google is.
Yeah, Google's really, uh, a headache.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   38:21
Alright, it's only tabs open. There you go. OK.
Can you send me the fake? So you have his real database or the fake stuff?

Lem   38:33
The.

Bryan Wolf   38:36
Just send me whatever you have for sheets, Google sheets. I can, I can copy it.

Lem   38:37
For the.
Yeah, the Google sheet was on the test. Uh, test database.

Bryan Wolf   38:44
Oh, is it an e-mail?

Lem   38:47
On the oh wait, no, it's not on the e-mail. Let me just pull it up also. So this is actually, but the data here is actually.
Like real data from Peter, so.
Then let me just send yours this one.
OK.
But.
Oh.
Yes.

Bryan Wolf   39:41
That is the worst coffee.
Alright, thanks, love.

Lem   39:47
No, no problem.
I mean the.
Yeah, I I sent you also the the an e-mail for the database.
Yeah.
Yeah, this one on the most.
On the last part, so the spreadsheet.

Bryan Wolf   40:27
What is this? Uh, I'm putting this In the bottom of the A agent or?

Lem   40:31
Oh, right. Yeah, the description. That's for the task one and then task 2.

Bryan Wolf   40:35
Well, so.

Lem   40:39
Uh, I think we could do this.

Bryan Wolf   40:40
And I'm putting where am I putting this? I'm putting this In here.

Lem   40:45
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   40:45
I'm putting this In here.

Lem   40:48
Yeah, later when we already have the. I don't. No, no, no on the. Yeah, on. It's actually on the like on the tools. Yep, that's right. Yeah, yeah, the actual thing.

Bryan Wolf   40:49
The tools can I do now or now?
OK.
I gotta put them In first. Yeah, the actual thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, OK, so I just.

Lem   41:03
So we could just add that one, uh, later when everything is already set up.

Bryan Wolf   41:06
Oh.
Man, this is the worst coffee tasting lead.

Lem   41:11
Oh, I think you've added a old one. Yeah, yeah, the old one, I think. Yeah, OK.

Bryan Wolf   41:13
I did.
I did, Lem. I did. Here we go.
That is just the worst coffee I've ever had.

Lem   41:27
Coffee.

Bryan Wolf   41:30
Yeah, I'm having bad coffee right now. Sorry. OK, so did you send me this this stuff though? Yeah.

Lem   41:33
Uh.
Yeah, that spreadsheet on, it's on the last part. It's just the the prompt is very long. So yeah, that one. Yep, if you just duplicate this one and then yeah, but the data here is actually.

Bryan Wolf   41:44
Yeah.

Lem   41:50
Like, uh, real data from. I think, uh, we've imported this one from the Outlook CSV file of Peter.

Bryan Wolf   42:01
It's just the worst.

Lem   42:02
So you could.

Bryan Wolf   42:02
It's just the worst.
Oh, I'm sorry, hold on.

Lem   42:07
Oh, it's on the different account. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   42:10
I just sent it to Peter.

Lem   42:13
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   42:16
Did I do that actually?

Lem   42:19
Uh, I think you could open the link here. Uh, just copy the link and then open the tab with Peter's.
Um, Nope. Uh, this would.

Bryan Wolf   42:32
Oh **** ****. I got you. I got you like this file.

Lem   42:35
Yeah, yeah.
Because this would create.
Yeah, just to copy the link and then open on the other tab, yeah.
So.

Bryan Wolf   42:49
How do I open up the link?

Lem   42:51
I just put it on the like the link here on the website. What you call that one like the where we put the website. Yeah, just add it there and then Nope. I just remove first every. Yeah, I think it. Yeah, OK.
So that we could, what you call that? Duplicate this one on Peter's file. Yeah, Peter's account. Yeah. So now we could duplicate this one. Then it would go to Peter's file. Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   43:21
OK, sorry.
Uh.

Lem   43:27
Um.

Bryan Wolf   43:29
I'll just not do it like that.

Lem   43:30
And uh, make a copy up.

Bryan Wolf   43:39
The.

Lem   43:43
Um.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   43:51
Sorry, I'm moving slow today.

Lem   43:53
No, no problem. It's OK. We we've got time, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   43:59
Yeah, that's right. That's right, I guess.
I have too much **** going on, so cancel this.
Let's.
Once over.
Might not be here yet though.
Uh.

Lem   44:33
Contact card.
Mm.
OK.
On demand, yeah, all right. We you could change the trigger to on demand. Change the. Yeah, that one first. So I think that's the it's.
Yeah, yeah, you could activate it, no problem.
And then Yep, I think it's that's good already. So most of these are just Google sheets, Google sheet and then we we don't need to map anything.

Bryan Wolf   45:26
OK.

Lem   45:31
So it's just um.

Bryan Wolf   45:33
Now hold on, I gotta make sure.

Lem   45:35
Oh, right. Yeah, the it's.

Bryan Wolf   45:38
It's this one.

Lem   45:40
Um.

Bryan Wolf   45:43
No, I'm just gonna delete these other ones that are already here.

Lem   45:47
Yeah, this was on July 11, so I think, uh, it's much better because uh, they're uh, the same name, I think. So maybe you'll get confused later.

Bryan Wolf   45:49
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I will.
Any plans for the weekend, Lem? Come on, I need to hear something exciting.

Lem   46:20
Uh.
Yeah, we're invited on a birthday. No, just a birthday tomorrow. Yeah, the husband of my aunt having a birthday, so he invited US, also and on.

Bryan Wolf   46:23
Another wedding.
Wow. OK, OK.
Do you like him?

Lem   46:38
Yeah, just just OK. Just OK. Yeah, it's just OK.

Bryan Wolf   46:40
He's OK. Oh, you do like him? He's just OK. He's just OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah, OK, OK.

Lem   46:47
Yeah, but on Sunday we I'm actually meeting the like the groom groom from last week. We're yeah, we're gonna visit his house. So he actually already moved. So it's like a housewarming, housewarming party and something like that.

Bryan Wolf   46:54
Yeah.
A little party. Yeah. Housewarm party. Yeah. Yeah. Hell yeah.

Lem   47:05
Yeah, like drink some little alcohol, maybe, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   47:09
Yeah, love, OK.

Lem   47:14
OK.
Yeah, but actually next week on Wednesday, I'm already going back again to Manila Laguna.

Bryan Wolf   47:30
Vanilla Laguna.

Lem   47:31
Yeah, on Laguna. So just two week, just two weeks here on Davao on my hometown. So just this is that here and.

Bryan Wolf   47:34
And where where are you right now?
Mhm.
Any of your old girlfriends live there?

Lem   47:45
Yeah, yeah. No, she's on Laguna. So that's where I'm staying also. And I'm just like going back and forth here. Yeah, yeah, basically.

Bryan Wolf   47:52
Mhm.
Taking a break from her. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's funny.

Lem   48:07
Um.
So uh, Nick also is working on Uh from Sirala or he's on a different?

Bryan Wolf   48:25
Yeah, so Peter and Nick both have.
Oh my God, excuse me. Peter and Nick both have full time jobs. They both have full time jobs for other companies like Nick. Nick works full time for Accusure. Peter works full time for a different insurance company.

Lem   48:34
Oh, bless you.
Oh, OK, I see.
OK.

Bryan Wolf   48:49
So they have other careers, they they have other jobs. This is just part time to them, you know, it's just an internship for the summer and that's why their their commitment is like their hours are not as long.

Lem   48:50
Oh, yeah.
Yep.
Yeah, they're they're actually also like pretty busy, right? With their full time work, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   49:05
Um.
Yeah, like, you know, they can get on In the warnings, but later In the day it's harder, I think. Um.

Lem   49:16
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   49:21
So that's why Bart. Bart works directly for Sorrell. He's on my dad's team. He's on Peter's team. But Nick, Nick likes this stuff. Nick. Nick's already been studying a lot of this stuff. A lot of this.

Lem   49:26
Mm OK.

Bryan Wolf   49:39
AI related content and even make. He's been involved with make before, so he already has like a good knowledge base of you know this field.

Lem   49:45
Yep.
OK, but his work on is really. Is he also like a developer there on the or mostly on the?

Bryan Wolf   49:59
No. So he's like, no, no, no, no. So he doesn't do any AI developing for his actual company, for Akishore. He does something. He's just an underwriter for insurance. It is it. I think it's what he he would prefer to work.

Lem   50:01
OK.
Oh, OK, yeah. So it's just like his.

Bryan Wolf   50:16
Not doing that, not selling insurance, not doing, uh, working for extra. He'd like to pursue this full time. He actually said I think he want he'd prefer if he was just hired by Sorrella instead. Um, but.

Lem   50:21
OK, I see.
Mhm.
I see.

Bryan Wolf   50:32
So that's why their hours are a little different. But I like Nick is you know, you can just give Nick a task and he'll complete it like you know, at random times. Good. All right, now I have to put In this.

Lem   50:34
Yep.
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   50:48
To this now I gotta put this on his GP2.

Lem   50:53
Yep, on.

Bryan Wolf   50:57
I don't know if I have his.
I do. OK, so now oh, this looks.

Lem   51:17
OK.

Bryan Wolf   51:18
Uh, he's gonna. This is not his. This is not his real one. OK, hold on. Let's see if I can.

Lem   51:18
Uh, yeah, it's still. Yeah, it's still free.

Bryan Wolf   51:32
Uh.
Uh.
Hold on, I gotta forget it. I gotta look this up my phone.

Lem   51:57
OK.
On.
Yes.

Bryan Wolf   52:39
Just look this up real quick.
I got it right here, actually.

Lem   53:13
Sh.

Bryan Wolf   53:14
Yeah, I gotta unshare my screen for a minute. I'm sorry.

Lem   53:17
OK, no problem.

Bryan Wolf   53:53
Sorry.

Lem   54:26
Images.

Bryan Wolf   54:30
OK, I'm about to be in one second.
What the **** did I just?

Lem   55:01
OK.

Bryan Wolf   55:47
And let's see if this works here.
What the ****?
Oh, I can't believe my Google sheets doesn't work.

Lem   56:09
It's not working or?

Bryan Wolf   56:11
No, I know. Hold on. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just talking to myself.

Lem   56:13
Yeah, no, no problem. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   56:20
Um, excuse me, what the ****?
And I'm in, I think. OK, great. Yeah. So let's see this.
Alright, so I'm gonna build.

Lem   57:17
Um, Yep, great. And then.
For the instruct. Oh right, the instructions. So I'll I can just.

Bryan Wolf   57:34
Yeah.

Lem   57:36
Put it in the chat. Uh, it's just short, so it's, uh, it's all good.

Bryan Wolf   57:38
Yeah.
That'd be great.

Lem   57:46
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   57:52
Get from actions GPT. I gotta get this GP2.

Lem   57:56
Yeah, you could also copy the my schema and then, but yeah, you could try this one, the actual GPT also.

Bryan Wolf   57:57
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me, let me just do that. I'm just gonna do that. No, no, no. I'd rather just. I'd rather just call because I I got it right here.

Lem   58:16
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   58:17
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, he's so good.

Lem   58:19
Uh, Nope. I think this is uh.
Yeah, yeah, this is a different one. This is actually like the Jason file for the.

Bryan Wolf   58:31
You sent me this cabin the other day. Hold on. I have it. I have it. I have it. I will find it.

Lem   58:33
Yep, that's right. Yeah. On the Google Doc. Yep. So it's on the Google Doc. You could also open this. Oh, right. Yeah. Yep.
I think that's it from the open API up to.
And then?
And then you could just paste.

Bryan Wolf   59:07
I am all over the place, man. I am all over the place. I'm sorry. What the ****?

Lem   59:13
Yeah.
Hello.
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   59:57
Yes.
Prescription. I'll just leave it at that.

Lem   1:00:05
Uh, this description.
I think we could just put, yeah, we could just. You could also put this one. I'll put it in the chat. It's just a simple description. I think database a agent that has access to my database. Yeah, database.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:12
Lito.

Lem   1:00:25
Or Google sheet. Uh, but yeah, you could copy my on the chat.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:29
Yeah, I know. If you could send it, yeah, that'd be great.

Lem   1:00:32
Yeah.
Should be, I think an AI agent that has access. It's not too redundant, but yeah, it's just a description so that.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:45
It's OK.

Lem   1:00:50
And then oh oh right wait for the hook. So you would need to copy the yeah change the the as you can see on after the paths so that that yeah that one so you could copy the.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:50
OK.

Lem   1:01:08
Um, can you copy the webbook? Can you go back to make.com and then?

Bryan Wolf   1:01:16
This is the webhook right here.

Lem   1:01:17
Yeah, but it's actually after the make.com, right? So let's just go first on the.
Uh, make.com on the webbooks. Let's copy your web web webbook first on the.
Um, can you go back to the? Yeah, so you need to create a new scenario and.
And.
Yeah. And then in import the no, just import the custom GPT interface. So I I've also sent you the Jason file, the one that you. Yeah, this one. Yeah, that's that's right. Then click save. Yep. And then.
Yeah, just create a webhook here. Add the webhook, just name it like.
Database Webhook. OK, that's good.
And then click save and then yeah, so as you can see there, there's like the after make.com slash. So that's the one that we would copy so.
I think you could just copy it and then let's just remove it.
Just copy it on the schema and then on the custom GPT. So yeah, as you can see here on the paths below the paths, so just remove that one. Yep, remove that one and then don't remove the call.
Yeah, and then you could just paste the link.
And then remove again the no. Yeah. So just add the slash there. Slash. Just one slash. Yep. OK, Yep. So that's good. And then, Yep, great.
Uh.
OK, that's good. So now we need to incorporate the tools on our AI agent. So go back again to the let's go back to the make AI agents. Yep, that's right.
And then yeah, database pooler then below that one. So we we're gonna add the.
Descriptions.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:03
Where are the tools I just saw them?

Lem   1:04:08
Yeah, that that that one. So that task one.
OK.
Then she go below you get add on the system tools.
So click add on the system tools.
On the bottom part, Yep, that's right. And then yeah, just search the. I think you could also open the folder, the record retrieval folder.
On the left side, so I think that's much easier.
Yep. So yeah, task one. Yeah, a description. That's right. And oh, it's still not active. So yeah, just click save. And then we need to actually activate all of them, so.
Uh, click. Just click first the check mark. So uh, not sure if you could add it even though it's not active. So Yep.
Um.
Yeah, we need to activate the.
6 Also the last one. OK and then Yep, that's good.
The agents and then.
And.
Need to add the.
Record retrieval.
Yeah.
Um.
Yeah, that's already good. So we just need to add the descriptions on the, yeah, assign it to the AA agent on the tools and then, Yep, that's right and then.
Go to the task one.
Uh.
Oh, I think it's on below on the lower side. Yeah, that's right. That's right. Below. Oh, it's already have. Yeah, you just click the the check mark on the right side there and then you can click add. Yep.
And then yeah, for the task two we need the also the description, so you could copy the description from.
Yes.
We're, um, what you called it?
On the Outlook on the e-mail, so the description is there on the.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:00
Oh, Lem, I've been. I've been muted. I've been muted. Hold on, Lem. Look, so there's the task two isn't on there. Neither is 3 or four, but these two aren't showing up.

Lem   1:08:08
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:11
Like when we go to here.

Lem   1:08:11
It's not.
It's not showing up.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:16
Tools for the tools. I mean, see, look, it's just four and five.

Lem   1:08:16
Oh.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:25
It just ***** something up.

Lem   1:08:25
Yeah, that's odd. Oh, maybe that trigger is not on demand, so can we go back to the?
Yeah, so it it can. I think it can.
Yeah. So it's actually, yeah, it's on polling. Yeah, on polling trigger, yeah. So it needs to be on demand so that the.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:39
I think it is on demand now. Look, uh, you're right, it regular. OK, save.

Lem   1:08:49
Uh EA agent could access it also.
And then, Yep, so I think that that's.
It can access it now, so task.
Two. Yep, that's twist there.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:07
Oh.
OK.
Alright, finally got that.

Lem   1:11:08
Yep, yeah, I think this is good. Uh, just, uh, save it and then.
Um, now we could, yeah, we could try it on your custom GPT.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:46
You gotta be ******* kidding me though. Not save it.

Lem   1:11:49
Oh no, it's on. Yeah, yeah, that's one. The database is extractor.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:53
OK.

Lem   1:11:56
OK, let's try it. Um, you could also check the.
Let me check the database. So for example, uh, Shannon Abella.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:08
So I asked GPT or the OK.

Lem   1:12:08
Good.
Yeah, the yeah, the GPT. You could directly go to GPT here.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:14
I do this.

Lem   1:12:16
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:27
Google.

Lem   1:12:38
Um, yeah, anyone so.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:40
Bella.
What should I ask? What company does she work for?

Lem   1:12:52
Um yeah, just ask like um uh can you give me the all the information for?

Bryan Wolf   1:13:00
Bell.

Lem   1:13:01
Uh, Shannon Abila, something like that or?
OK.
Then click the confirm. So uh, it's the.
On Nope. On the ChatGPT as you can see databases wants to talk to. Yeah, just click the confirm. So it needs always needs verification. So that's the only thing here.
Webhook not found. Please check the configuration or try again. No that. Oh, that's odd. So let's go back to the hook.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:05
I can put.

Lem   1:14:07
Can you?
Not sure why it's.
So let me just check my.
Can you Scroll down on the on at the bottom?
At the bottom there. Yep. And yeah, so can you? Yes, it's actually.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:30
2nd.
OK, yeah, here.

Lem   1:14:42
Let's just double check if it's the same. Yep, there on.
So S94 VUO.
Yes, it's actually the same.
Uh.
OK, can can you click test first the you can you see the test there? Yeah.
And then confirm. Click confirm.
The book not found please.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:21
Fail outbound call.

Lem   1:15:24
Oh, that's odd.
CG Gulf St.
And.
Um.
No color API authentication non host.
Oh.
So paths is.
Uh.
Post.
Yeah, it should be the same.
Oh right, can you go back to your make.com? Let me just check if I think it's the right as you can see the hook dot US2 dot make.com. So just change the.
Um, go back to custom GPT.
And then change the EU two to US two, so on the URL on the servers, so above that paths, yeah that one. So it's EU two, so that's why it's not not just change it to US to the hook dot US2.
Yep, that's right. Yeah. Hook dot USCN. OK, yeah, I think this works. So just click the upper upper right side and update it. OK then.
Yeah, I think this should work already. Yeah, we could also test it. Yeah. So then click confirm. I want to talk to you, you hook.
Then.
Yeah, can you click the lower? Yeah, this one.
Uh, it's Uh. Operation did not succeed. The server failed to complete. Please check the webbook operation. Can you check our?
Uh, the make.com if.
And then can you go to history? So I I just want to see if it actually triggered the.
Um, can you open that one? Not sure why this errored out so.
Oh, the uh agent ID not current request.
Uh.
Can you open the webhook on the left side? Yeah, this one.
Um, yeah, it's on the.
Yeah. Can we go back to Test Assistant? So no on. I think the Webhook is good. It's just the yeah, this one on the AI agent.
Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:15
Where do you want me to go?

Lem   1:19:16
On the yeah, can we go, uh, inside the diagram? I I just want to see the.
The Yep, the the and then click this one. That's. Oh yeah, I think I see where the problem is. Yeah, and then choose the agent. So as you can see, there's no agent there. I haven't mapped it out yet. So yeah, great. Choose the database puller.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:38
That would help, wouldn't it?

Lem   1:19:38
And yeah, yeah, that's right. And then have you saved it or?
For for the message, can you just also map it again? So maybe I'm not sure if yeah, the message so.
Um.
But I think it's already fine. Can you go click the star, the left, the other one, the most left? Oh right, we we still don't have the data. But yeah, I think this is good. That's actually good. And then just click save.
And then, yeah, I think this should be fine. And then we could already test it again, then confirm.
Yeah, so this is good. It's their guest call. All right. Yeah, so it didn't work. Can we go back again? Let's check the history. So not sure why did error out.
Oh yeah, it's so it's already success, but I think there's just no response. So yeah.
And.
Can we check the history for for the other one on the success? Yeah, the one that is successful. Yeah, this one. So quick details. I just want to check the.
Response on the right. Uh, the third one, the third node.
OK. OK. So this is, this is good. Yeah, yeah, that's good. So yeah, we we could now talk to the A agent using your custom GPT. So that's fine. So Yep, OK, so now you could ask the again like.
Yeah.
Then just, uh, pictures a person there or something.
Not sure if I'm there, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:54
Getting on getting them, I'm kidding.
Kidding, love. I'm kidding.
Whatever just gave me your entire life story.
Shannon Abella.
It's got a picture of her.

Lem   1:22:19
No, no, this is oh, I think can you go back to the settings again to the settings? So this is because I we actually didn't.
And then, uh, scrolled. Um, Scroll down. Yeah, So what I did here is I untoggled the capabilities, which is the web search, canvas and uh, yeah, four O image because it's actually like.
And then click update because I we didn't add it on the prompt yet like that. The prompt is just generic for now, so we could just add, yeah, tell me.
Yeah, I think it confirm.
It's taking. Yep. So I think it worked. Yep. OK, then, yeah, now. So now we have access to the AA agent on your make. So that's good. That's great.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:34
Whoop. Whoop. Nice.

Lem   1:23:39
Yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:42
Bart emails.

Lem   1:23:44
I'm not sure.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:46
No, I didn't.

Lem   1:23:50
And then he did.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:58
All right.

Lem   1:24:05
Yep. So now it's working. Yeah, that's great.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:12
Um.

Lem   1:24:13
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:14
I love you. Good, I think.

Lem   1:24:16
Pardon. Come again. Oh, yeah, yeah, right. Yeah, we could. You could like, like what? What you call this one?

Bryan Wolf   1:24:17
We're good.

Lem   1:24:30
Stress test it like asking give me the list of all the people on finance, something like that. So but.
But yeah, the the your question also should be on the database because if it's not a ChatGPT will just said I can't find information something like that. So if you for example like the job description, can you give me all of the people who are like subcontractor or yeah so there are.
Yeah, like lots of subcontractor there. So for example, can you give me all the people?
Who has a subcontractor in their job description, so something like that.
OK.
And yeah, so this is really annoying, the the two stuff. Yeah, it would be very good if like, yeah, yeah, if you didn't ask for permission, if it's streamlined. I actually asked ChatGPT about that and we need to like have an external like server for that.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:33
It is. It is.
You can just do it.

Lem   1:25:49
One, so that, yeah, the process would be like, uh, there's like a next step.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:53
I didn't get it.

Lem   1:25:54
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:25:57
Stewart Amor Praveen.
Kalpash Gordon.

Lem   1:26:04
Uh.
Yep, it's cool.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:08
Yeah, we did get it. Never mind.

Lem   1:26:13
Um, so there are just five, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:26:19
Yeah.

Lem   1:26:20
Oh, I see.

Bryan Wolf   1:26:21
Yeah, sorry, Lem. Yes, there are only 5.

Lem   1:26:25
Yep, I think so.
Okay, that's great.
Wow.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:27
All right, that looks good.
Looks good.
Everything looks good. You're the man. You save the day every day.
Can you hear me? I think you're muted.

Lem   1:27:45
Oh, I was talking. I was muted. Yeah, yeah, because I have like a little cold, so I'm just muting some sometimes. So whenever I sneeze.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:48
Classic. Classic.
OK, OK. All right, well, I'm good. I'm gonna hop off it. And then I would just keep an eye out for Bart's e-mail. I don't know when he's gonna send it. It's gonna be today, later today when you're asleep, but I would just keep an eye out for it.

Lem   1:27:59
But yeah.
OK.
The is it? Is it the prom or the news flow or IRS?

Bryan Wolf   1:28:13
So I think he's just gonna add. I know. So he's gonna add to the prompt and then he's gonna, uh, talk about some reputable RSS feed stuff that we can add in. But that's it. Just I think he's just gonna loop you in the e-mail just so you can see what's going on, what he changed.

Lem   1:28:19
OK. Yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:28:33
Nobody wants to add, but yeah, that's all.

Lem   1:28:33
OK, yeah. OK, no problem. Yep, no problem. OK, Bry. OK, talk to you soon. OK. Yeah. Monday. Yep. Yeah. OK. Yeah, you too, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:28:36
All right, brother, I'm gonna get off.
I'll talk to you tomorrow. No, I'll talk to you Monday.
Monday. Alright then. Have a good weekend, man.
Thank you, brother.

Lem   1:28:49
OK. OK. Bye.
