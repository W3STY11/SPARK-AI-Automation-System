Oh, OK, you guys know? Yeah. So where are we at right now with the with the newsletter?

Bryan Wolf   3:39
What he's doing?

Lem Quimpo   3:44
OK.
Yeah, I've already put the like the updates he wanted. The updates was just a few like we added the today's inside. So let me just.
Share my screen. So it's yeah, it looks like this. That's the today's insights is just 6-5 to six words so that it would be much cleaner.
And then the AI finance news is just in one section separated with like a horizontal line. So AI finance news just all in one section and then for the.
Uh.
Yeah, this one also the serral daily inside. So we have like the if it's a video or a blog, so it's there and then we have the like the author and position or title. So we have video.

Bartosz Borek   4:41
OK.
So this is the this is randomly taking something from that list, right?

Lem Quimpo   4:51
From the uh, no, we we're actually setting it up like um.

Bartosz Borek   4:53
Yeah.
Oh, we're setting it up right now. OK, gotcha.

Lem Quimpo   4:59
Yeah, we're we're actually choosing the what what particular like daily insights to include on this newsletter. So we have that here on the.
Yeah, we have there on the including newsletter, so we could just, uh, click the check mark here and then oh, I need to update the.
Processed.

Bartosz Borek   5:34
Brian, did you make the changes on your end as well? The latest ones? Oh, OK.

Bryan Wolf   5:37
No. So he did this over the weekend, so whatever he did, we'll e-mail it to me or we'll just stay on the call and I'll get it done with him.

Lem Quimpo   5:39
Um, yeah, this one is.

Bartosz Borek   5:44
OK.
Now what's the? Has there been any status with the problem around the serral e-mail? Any updates there?

Lem Quimpo   5:53
Mhm.

Bryan Wolf   5:56
No, I mean, we have to talk to Pete. I don't know. Um.

Lem Quimpo   5:56
Um.

Bartosz Borek   5:59
Yeah, I'm not. OK. I'm not sure where we. I don't remember where we left that on Friday because.

Lem Quimpo   5:59
Mm.

Bryan Wolf   6:05
I Can try and get him along. I don't know what he's doing right now.

Bartosz Borek   6:09
I don't know if there was anything.

Lem Quimpo   6:10
Yeah, on the e-mail one, yeah, that that would be.

Bartosz Borek   6:13
That's a problem, because that's a problem for sure.

Bryan Wolf   6:15
Yeah, for sure.

Lem Quimpo   6:17
If we like use the seral@serala.com so yeah we would need we we would really need to like connect that one to your like website. So on the like the settings we have there like.
The domain that is like the website domain. So for example this one yeah we need to like add your domain here and then it will just like have an authentication depending on the website. So you can like open your for example week site.

Bryan Wolf   6:45
Yes.

Lem Quimpo   6:48
Or like a WordPress and then yeah, we need to connect that here so that yeah, we can send it via the at seral.com. Yeah, so if if we use for example this one, so I'm using@gmail.com, so that's what.

Bryan Wolf   6:49
Um.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   7:08
Why there's something like this? So if your sender are not compliant with for each sender checker DKI so we can I I can still send the e-mail right? Like we were you guys are receiving it on your like personal accounts like at gmail.com but it's not sending on the like at sorala.com so I think.
It's blocking that one because of this, so it's a free domain. It's not recommended, so free mail domains. So they they're really recommending like the professional like emails or like the company emails.

Bryan Wolf   7:28
Right.

Bartosz Borek   7:31
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   7:39
Lem, I have a domain if you want to try it like I paid for a domain name.

Lem Quimpo   7:41
OK.
Oh, OK, Yep, we could, uh, use that one.

Nicholas Westburg   7:48
It's not. Obviously it's not a Serral, it's just like a Google workspace 'cause I pay for that and I pay for the the domain that you know.

Lem Quimpo   7:52
Yep.
Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah. But for the Serrala one, we need to connect it here, right? For the, yeah, the customer e-mail. So that would be, I think, one of the challenges there.

Nicholas Westburg   7:58
Hold on with it.

Bryan Wolf   8:02
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   8:02
No.

Lem Quimpo   8:12
But yeah, yeah we we need to also update because I've updated like a lot of just 33 automations here Bryan like the content aggregator.
Formatter and also the yeah the daily insights. So just this three.

Bryan Wolf   8:28
Good.

Lem Quimpo   8:35
Then I think we're good to go. So we haven't really changed much of the just this one. So it's inputting much like tighter list and then just the section. So put in in one section and then.
Yeah, I think that's it. And then adding the like the this one video. So we added it on, we added a column column here on our newsletter is saying the category content. Yeah, the content category.
Then yeah, that's just the update for that one. I think we would still need the like the photo banner and yeah, that's the remaining thing. I think the photo here and.

Bryan Wolf   9:19
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   9:25
In.
Yeah, the three photos. I'm not sure if we would use like the black one here or something, but Yep.

Bryan Wolf   9:32
I think you've got to find other ones, different ones. I don't know if we Can use the black one, but Ben, do you want to walk through with me the changes you made or you just want to send them to Jason?

Lem Quimpo   9:42
Yeah, I think I would need to send because I changed some like other, yeah, other filters here.

Bryan Wolf   9:53
OK.

Lem Quimpo   9:54
And then yeah, I think it it'd be much easier to also like I also uh added the uh like a prompt also here.

Bryan Wolf   9:57
That's okay.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   10:14
Could just copy and paste the prompt. So for this one, yeah, I added this extract. Oops, the extract get content category from the website. So we need to update that one.
Yes. So I think we we could just do this.

Bryan Wolf   10:29
OK.

Lem Quimpo   10:34
Both of this one.
Then you can just copy and paste the prompt from for here for this one. Then I also updated already updated the.
The yeah, the Google sheets like the app script there is already good, already updated that one. So yeah, I think that's good. Let me just send you the.

Bryan Wolf   10:49
But she.
OK.
Oh, mine, you're talking about, right?

Lem Quimpo   11:06
Pardon. Uh, come again, right?

Bryan Wolf   11:07
The one that I gave you access to.

Lem Quimpo   11:10
Yeah, yeah, the Google sheets. So I already updated the like the yeah, the apps, apps script there and also the the columns, so.

Bryan Wolf   11:12
Yeah.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   11:21
That should be good, yes. So this only and then prompt for.
Three content formatter. So this one you could just copy paste it on the yeah, it's much easier.

Bryan Wolf   11:39
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   11:43
Yes, uh.
Sounds good.
And then, Yep, I think, uh, we're good. Test that out.
In.
I also already actually updated the LinkedIn flow with all the yeah the.

Bryan Wolf   12:07
Oh, great.

Lem Quimpo   12:10
All the updates, uh, Peter wanted. Yeah, change the INA reader to.

Bryan Wolf   12:16
And that's it.

Lem Quimpo   12:22
Like, um, yeah, perplexity with, uh, different topics to search for.
And then?
Yeah, I think that's.
Very good.
Still.

Bryan Wolf   13:26
Excuse me?

Lem Quimpo   14:05
So are we going to test it out also on your end or we didn't? Is it updated? I'm not sure if.

Bryan Wolf   14:13
Yeah.
I definitely have to.

Lem Quimpo   14:22
Oh, it's uh.
The.

Bryan Wolf   14:33
You can send me the link and stuff. That'd be cool. Good too.

Lem Quimpo   14:35
Yeah.
Oh, it's. Yeah, you you turned off the automation, I think for this one, right? Yeah, it's still not updating.

Bryan Wolf   14:42
For what? For nine?

Lem Quimpo   14:46
Yeah, for, I think, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   14:48
Yeah, I have one turned off.

Lem Quimpo   16:24

Yeah, the uh documentation for.

Bryan Wolf   16:32
Yeah.

6/7.

Peter Wolf   18:58
Hey, guys.

Lem Quimpo   19:05
Hey, Peter, morning.

Peter Wolf   19:08
Morning.

Lem Quimpo   19:09
9th step Uh.
Yes, so the content is this.

Bryan Wolf   19:17
Did you figure out what we can do with this rally now?
E.

Peter Wolf   19:23
Was that a question to me?

Bryan Wolf   19:27
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   19:27
What was the question?

Bryan Wolf   19:29
So the brevo doesn't send to Soralas.

Peter Wolf   19:32
No, I have a call scheduled. I have a call scheduled at 11:00 or 12:00 today.
We're talking about the domain thing to get it so that they don't get blocked.

Bryan Wolf   19:43
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bartosz Borek   19:44
Yeah, yeah, Yep, exactly, Peter.

Lem Quimpo   19:45
OK.

Peter Wolf   19:49
All right, So what are we doing now?

Lem Quimpo   19:52
Brand is still hooking up the two automation, the new newly updated one and then also already actually tested it. So let me just.

Peter Wolf   20:01
OK.

Lem Quimpo   20:09
Blow this for a minute. Yeah, so now the.
Yeah, the bullet points are much cleaner, so I've added just a 5 to 6 words.

Peter Wolf   20:20
Right. Is this already sent? Was I copied on this one? This version?

Lem Quimpo   20:21
Per.
Yeah, yeah, the the one that they sent right now. So this is already there and then the AI finance news also is just in one section with.

Peter Wolf   20:27
OK.

Lem Quimpo   20:38
Like separator as horizontal line and then for the serala insights we have the this one like the blog video we have that here. So we're getting this one from just yeah the link.

Peter Wolf   20:40
Yep, Yep, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   20:40
Dial.

Peter Wolf   20:52
Yep, perfect. Love it.

Lem Quimpo   20:57
And then author and position title, yes, already here. Yeah, yeah, I think that's the, yeah, we that's the update that we wanted to put there.

Peter Wolf   21:01
Great.
Yeah. So really it's just down to these banners now for from a content perspective, it's the banners and then it's the emails and the Bravo set up domain part, OK.

Lem Quimpo   21:10
Yeah, the banners.

Bryan Wolf   21:12
Good.

Lem Quimpo   21:18
Yeah, that's right. Yep. Uh.
Yeah, the banners and the emails.

Peter Wolf   21:26
OK. Then can we, can we sidetrack though? I mean, Brian, if Brian needs to work on this and he can work on that, I don't want to keep everybody tied up on that. Certainly not Bart. If we're just doing clean up stuff on that, then you guys can spend time on that or schedule it. But let's let's go.

Lem Quimpo   21:27
OK.

Peter Wolf   21:46
Look at the other flows and figure out what we need to do, what I'm really going to move into the other environment and not. I really don't think I'm going to move the the newsletter into the Microsoft environment. I just don't see material value in that. Now ultimately if they really do move forward, they may.

Lem Quimpo   21:50
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   21:57
Oh.

Lem Quimpo   22:04
OK.

Peter Wolf   22:06
They, they mean the marketing team may feel that this needs to be in our environment, but I don't see it being proprietary information. It's there's no systems there other than potentially in Marketo, which would be an issue as far as connecting and delivering the content to that instead of Bretto.

Lem Quimpo   22:24
Yep.

Peter Wolf   22:25
But it's such a big process flow taking it over there. I don't know is going to bring us much value and I think it's going to be a lot of work. And so I want to focus on the on the company profile one the report because I think that's a good one to take over and we can tie into.

Lem Quimpo   22:41
OK.

Peter Wolf   22:43
Into Zoom Info, we can tie it into Salesforce. So that's a good one, right? And the individual posting one, I think because it's relatively small, that can go as well. So I'm still working with the IT team. They're being very.

Lem Quimpo   22:50
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   23:03
Very slow here in communicating and I think it's it. It looks like it might be partly just an issue of the person who I'm dealing with doesn't appear to be on US time zone hours, so she's sending me messages at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

Lem Quimpo   23:08
OK.
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   23:19
And then when I respond, then it's taking her another 24 hours to get back to me. But they are asking for clarification of what exactly I'm intending to do. So I gave them, sent them a couple process flows, including the LinkedIn post one.
And the research company one and and yeah, to give them clarity what I'm trying to achieve. The other thing is I this, this developer who I think I'm going to engage with, he actually has some process flows and so to get a sense of his skills and how quickly he Can set stuff up.

Lem Quimpo   23:40
We

Peter Wolf   23:56
We've agreed that he was going to create 2 process flows that he's already developed and used somewhere else. One of them is is similar to this LinkedIn posting. He has an automated function that would grab. I think it's articles or yeah, I'm pretty sure it's articles and it would make some kind of posting automatically, right?

Lem Quimpo   24:01
OK.

Peter Wolf   24:16
Right. So it goes through and do a similar type process. So I said great, go set your flow up. Let's see this flow, right, 'cause maybe we'll leverage stuff from it, maybe we won't. And then the other one.

Lem Quimpo   24:17
OK, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   24:20
On LinkedIn.

Lem Quimpo   24:26
Is it already on Power Automate or did you already?

Peter Wolf   24:31
No. Yeah, yes, yes. Power automate, yes.

Lem Quimpo   24:33
Oh, OK. Yep, that's good.

Peter Wolf   24:35
So, and he's not gonna charge me much at all. It was like $75.00 for each flow to put them in, which is certainly very reasonable. The other one was ****. What was the other one? Oh, the other one was a.

Lem Quimpo   24:42
OK, Yep.

Peter Wolf   24:53
Automated function at the end of of the of a teams meeting that automatically takes a transcript, runs a transcript through a function to create the summary and produce and deliver the summary out, right? These are just basic ones.

Lem Quimpo   25:08
Yep. OK. Yep.

Peter Wolf   25:09
But there's an example where you know I have that that prompt that does a, I always call it like the fidelity, kind of high fidelity summary of what was In the.
In the I use it for webinars and for transcripts and whatnot to give notes that are not embellished by content that the that the A I has its own, but only just taking what was truly In the material. And and so I assume it's something like that, right? Takes it, runs it through just.

Lem Quimpo   25:43
Yep.

Peter Wolf   25:45
Yeah, I'm sure just Microsoft Copilot takes a summary and then automatically sends it out. After what happens is at the end of the meeting the system asks do you want to send out the summary notes to everyone? Then he then you click on it. So I'm not sure. Again, this is just a basic flow, but this way I get a couple flows In there.

Lem Quimpo   26:01
OK.

Peter Wolf   26:05
There get something set up In the system and see what his what his basic processes look like and then maybe we Can leverage them. Maybe we can't. But these flows that I just said the the posting one and the and the company profile or company report one they they seem very.

Lem Quimpo   26:07
Yep.

Peter Wolf   26:23
Applicable to me and they're pretty straightforward. The the the posting one, yeah, maybe it's like a newsletter. You could do it just as easily on the outside, but I think it's a simple flow. So I want to just put it into the system. And yeah, then on the on the company one, the only thing with the company one is, yeah, when I look at that right there, right.

Lem Quimpo   26:25
OK.

Peter Wolf   26:43
That we ended up doing these multiple versions. I think we talked about this last week. We we looked at the spreadsheet and we were saying that the that the the difference was that the three different feeds, right, was slightly different feeds about whether it was Treasury.

Lem Quimpo   26:49
Yep.

Peter Wolf   26:59
Treasury transformation or whether it was technology or it was finance or something, right? And we were going to have three slightly different prompts for that. Is that what we agreed? But then we were still going to have these three paths or something?

Lem Quimpo   27:01
Yep.
Yep.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. The top the prompt here is from also from the like newsletter flow. So I'm not sure if we're gonna search the topics also on your list of websites or not. So I just added them also to prioritize searching for this list.
And then I've just differentiated it with topic and then yeah like 10 most widely shared on AI and finance. And then for example there here is on like finance transformation in Global 500 companies.
And then we're still feeding it to ChatGPT to like get the top three. Yeah, select the top three. No perplexity is already like get creating the summary and like the relevance. So explain the relevance here in the summary. So ChatGPT is just choosing which.

Peter Wolf   27:54
Select the best ones or to what to what? Get the summary.
OK.
Yep.
The best articles.

Lem Quimpo   28:09
Which two? Yeah, the best articles to input based on the summary and like the relevance. And then yeah, so then it will, yeah, already put it on the Google sheet and then yeah, just search for duplicates and stuff and then Yep.

Peter Wolf   28:14
OK.
OK. So when when we move this into the other environment, I expect I'll probably just go down to one flow, right? Not three that that that variety or complexity of having three different sources to me is probably not really adding a lot of value and maybe something that I would use or be useful, but I think In general.

Lem Quimpo   28:29
Oh.
The uh.
But.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   28:42
The single straight flow of of whatever your topic is, but it's uniform or you give it the breadth within a single prompt and get back to different variety of content and ultimately select from that. So I don't think having the three different paths is really adding a lot of value and certainly to move into the other environment.

Lem Quimpo   28:46
Yes.
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   29:01
The thing I want to do is get flows up quickly and and get them working and and really start to learn that environment, right? But that's good. So, so we now have this updated.

Lem Quimpo   29:08
Yep.
Yeah, this is already updated and we connected it also in the updated spreadsheet. So now we could choose. So whenever we trigger right after we trigger it here, this will populate and then it will populate. For example this one are these are new and then we could choose the.

Peter Wolf   29:30
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   29:33
Whoever is like yeah the person then after we click the create content so after we check mark the here so this will also like this will trigger and then this will be the one that will create the content which is claude.

Peter Wolf   29:34
The person's gonna do the posting, the blogging, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   29:48
And then also with feeding it the persona. So we have the switch module here also that whenever it depends on for example Brian Wolfe. So we have a switch module here that picks.

Peter Wolf   30:01
Fix a different persona upload input. OK.

Lem Quimpo   30:03
Yeah, picks up the that's right. Yeah, yeah. So the document ID here would be from Brian Wolfe or if it's Peter Wolfe. So the document ID would be for Peter Wolfe and then yeah, that would be fed to Claude. And then now it will go here, so it will be on the Google document. So we could like.
Check the Google document and then yeah the URL. So now we will if we if it's already good. So we would just click the ready to post and then after that one it would go to that route. For example we have the.
If it's on Bryan Wolf's, it will go to Bryan Wolf's account. If it's Peter Wolf's, it would go to Peter Wolf's account. So yeah.

Peter Wolf   30:42
Yeah.
And and so is the document updated to the meaning the documentation?

Lem Quimpo   30:49
The yeah, the SOPI haven't updated for this one yet. So the SOP. So yeah, I'll update this one. I think tomorrow together with the loom video, the new loom video also. So I will create a new loom video for this and the newsletter process flow.

Peter Wolf   30:50
The process flow documentation or SOP.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   31:09
And then, yeah, because this one is like, very different. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, the.

Peter Wolf   31:09
OK.
There is a document out there though, right? Even though we're going to tweak it, there is a document out there because if I pull this up when I talk to the CMO later on today, at least if I can show that the just walk through and give them a sense of it.
Can you? Let's clarify where that is. I'm going to my shared drive here cuz I think we had trouble finding it the other day. Documentation. I know where that is, right? Yeah, this thing. I stored this then locally. This has links to your. This is your Google Drive where these are.

Lem Quimpo   31:33
Uh, yeah.
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   31:46
This is your Google sheet.

Peter Wolf   31:46
Referencing or what?

Lem Quimpo   31:48
Yeah.
This is uh Google sheet uh.

Bryan Wolf   31:50
This one's yours, Pete. This is your process thoughts and negotiates.

Peter Wolf   31:52
Yeah.
I'm just saying the links to the to the documents, they're links to your Google Drive, not to ours. Yeah, OK.

Lem Quimpo   31:54
Uh.
Yeah, that's right. Yep, this is on my Google Drive, but I've added it all that so that anyone can view whenever they have the link so they can view the yeah, everything.

Bryan Wolf   32:02
OK.

Peter Wolf   32:08
Yeah, So what we're going to need to do though, Brian, and I already did this into my own PC, so it probably might even be easier, but we need to store these onto our onto our drive, my drive or onto Serrala's share drive. OK, all these different documents, but we're.

Bryan Wolf   32:21
Yeah.
OK.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   32:27
Yep.

Peter Wolf   32:27
Still updating so, but I don't want to. I want to make sure that I have these stored ultimately. OK then then on the but on the spreadsheet then again when it's linking to let's say over here in document column H.

Bryan Wolf   32:31
Right.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   32:33
OK.

Peter Wolf   32:42
The Google sheet for the for the not the database agent go down to the LinkedIn process flow one, right?

Lem Quimpo   32:43
Yep.
This one? Yep. This is also on my the test. Yeah, that's right, the sample.

Peter Wolf   32:53
On your share drive. Yeah, on your drive. OK, OK, alright.

Lem Quimpo   32:57
Um.

Peter Wolf   33:01
So we'll we'll download them. We don't need to do that right now, Brian, but that definitely needs to be done. I currently I have the link, so at least we can get to them and we'll wait until we get the further refinements. OK, so then we think we're good on the.

Bryan Wolf   33:06
Right.

Lem Quimpo   33:15
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   33:18
On the newsletter and what about the research company flow?

Lem Quimpo   33:22
Yeah, the research. Let me just open. Also the research company flow was still the first one. So the like the first version like the.
We haven't changed anything here yet, so uh, let me just open the.

Peter Wolf   33:38
OK.

Lem Quimpo   33:44
Mhm.
So we can just have the like this is just two flows.
Like the overview? Um.
Yeah, so it's this would trigger also from our Google sheet. So let me just open also the our Google sheet.
So this one start research and then I do a search for the Google sheet on where it is and then we would. So for this one the you wanted to the prompt is outside like the.

Peter Wolf   34:36
Yeah, because again, this could be maintained. We might order, change the structure, stuff like that. So I wanted that outside and make to to be more flexible.

Lem Quimpo   34:36
Outside the Yep.
OK.
Yeah. So, yeah, that's right. So, so it's outside and then, yeah, it's just searching the company using perplexity and then researching also like the what's the main website and formatting the content and then, yeah.
This is so we have the. The reason we have two routes here also is because we have the route if there's no job posting report and then if there's job posting report it will go to the that other route which has has the added step get job post content.

Peter Wolf   35:05
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   35:13
And then yeah, it will just create the like the document and then send the e-mail to for example to the static static e-mail here which is our e-mail and then it will also send to the ones that the custom e-mail here if you put some someone's e-mail here.

Peter Wolf   35:14
OK.

Lem Quimpo   35:31
And then, yeah, I that's it. So then the number two is every day. This is every day. This is triggering and it yeah, this is a job post. Yeah, job search. So this is searching every day and triggering every day and then depending on the job post, so it will.

Peter Wolf   35:37
It's the doing a job search one.
Job posting.

Lem Quimpo   35:49
Check the our spreadsheet if the company name is already here. So if the company name is already here so it won't continue and then if it's not it will create a job post based on the like the data on the that particular job post and then yeah it will just create the document and then get the.

Peter Wolf   35:52
Yep.
Yep.

Lem Quimpo   36:08
Link and then add it also here on our spreadsheet. So we just have one spreadsheet here and this is auto automatically updating every day with the different companies that has like the SAP jobs on Appify. And then you could also manually trigger it using like a company name here like a different company name if it's not here.
Then yeah, now we have the so the company report and like the job posting report as Google Doc. So with the yeah logo this one. Yep, so.

Peter Wolf   36:36
OK, yeah, good. All right. So then, So what we need to do, Brian, is really we should be managing this on the spreadsheet, that first spreadsheet that Lem has with the documentation. We should add a couple of columns there that say, you know, what's this?

Lem Quimpo   36:55
Yep. Um.

Peter Wolf   36:56
Status in our environment. Do we have it in our environment? Do we have it? Is it totally up to date? Is documentation up to date that right there, right? Because you need to, we need to go back and make sure these flows.

Lem Quimpo   37:00
Yeah.
Yep, this one.

Bryan Wolf   37:04
Yeah, I think today I'm gonna have to go through, I'm gonna have to go through all the flows and just iron out kinks, make sure everything works, test everything, and then I'll go and, you know, fill all that out.

Lem Quimpo   37:14
Yep.
Yeah, so now we're still updating. So the document here also is like, I'm updating it whenever we have, yeah, the update. So whenever it's all finalized, you can just actually like, yeah, just download the particular document and so that you could save it on your Google Drive.

Peter Wolf   37:22
Yeah.
Understood.

Lem Quimpo   37:36
Then they copy just format also Yep.

Peter Wolf   37:37
Yeah. OK. So let's, so that's that's then the and I would say Brian, obviously the newsletter needs to be updated so that we're ready to go. OK then.

Bryan Wolf   37:49
It is. That one's totally fine. It's just like the LinkedIn posting job, scraping job postings all and look at and whatever else you wanna implement over in Microsoft.

Lem Quimpo   37:51
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   37:54
Right. Yeah. Well, I'd say those, those first, right. The company, company report, the individual LinkedIn posting, the newsletter, those are the three we want to get working and then.

Lem Quimpo   37:55
Yep.

Peter Wolf   38:10
Um.

Lem Quimpo   38:12
Search company flow. Uh, yeah.

Peter Wolf   38:15
The uh.
Go up to the agent 1.

Lem Quimpo   38:21
I sold one.

Peter Wolf   38:22
The researcher or the agent? Yeah, database agent.

Bryan Wolf   38:23
OK. Yeah, I think that one's already good too as well, actually. Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   38:25
Yeah, the agent.

Peter Wolf   38:27
So this will be, hey, go ahead, go ahead.

Lem Quimpo   38:30
Yeah, the agent one is updated. So these are the all the documentations. Here are the newest version also like the loom videos. So this yeah this is just from July 18th. These are all updated ones.
OK.

Peter Wolf   38:46
Yeah. So again, Bry, is this in, is this in my environment?

Bryan Wolf   38:51
Yes, you have this new. You can access this, access all these videos, but these these are just like links so we can go in there and download them ourselves.

Lem Quimpo   38:53
Yeah, we, yeah.

Peter Wolf   38:59
Right. And what do we say? But right now these don't really have a front end interface or you did build that to the to the API for for ChatGPT, the input part. We talked about how there were two paths really. One path was actually me going into my ChatGPT, talking to my ChatGPT and having that.

Lem Quimpo   39:00
Yep.
dot.

Peter Wolf   39:19
Trigger the call to make. The other was that we would build a front end app or iPhone app or something that would be the interface to do that.

Lem Quimpo   39:30
Yeah, we connected. As I remember, we connected it to your ChatGPT. Then we tested it also there. Yep, on your environment. Yep, that's right. We tested it also.

Peter Wolf   39:36
OK.
We did test it there.
And you're saying this is also like right now if I go to my chat CBT and I I tell it or we have this stored or right? Because we took, didn't we take my first round of content from my Outlook, right?

Lem Quimpo   39:51
Yep.
Yeah, that's right. So yeah, the original data is on on yours and then you already duplicated this particular this mine, this is still on mine, right. But we on our last session on the AI agent, so we duplicated this one on your environment on your particular Google Drive. So you have this one already there, so.
Yeah, you could actually access that now. We just need to like maybe if it's not turned on. So you just need to turn on the automations for the agent because the tools for the agent tools on your make.com. So I'm not sure if it it's already turned on or something, but yeah, that's actually already working.

Peter Wolf   40:31
Can we actually, why don't we, if we Can do that right now, we Can get this activated to so that I could actually utilize this, that would be great.

Lem Quimpo   40:36
OK.
Yeah, yeah, it's already I think on your brand. Nope, it's we already set it all up like the ChatGPT. So the one that we only.

Peter Wolf   40:45
You were saying activate the API though.

Lem Quimpo   40:55
Need to turn on is the automations on your make.com in your environment. But yeah, so the last time we already tested it live also on your chat GPTN.

Peter Wolf   41:01
OK.
I didn't think so. I thought we only did it. We were still doing it with the manual input into Make. At the time we were we were plugging the text directly into Make. That's the last recollection I have.

Lem Quimpo   41:09
Uh.
Uh.
No, you know, one week where you were not around, I think for two days and then, yeah, Brian and me already hooked up.

Peter Wolf   41:26
No, I OK, great. No, if you guys did it, that's terrific. I wasn't involved In that. So I need to. Yeah, I don't even remember what the hell the wording is I'm supposed to use for it. So. So I guess if I look at the SOPI should be able to figure that out.

Lem Quimpo   41:29
Yep. Uh, yeah, yeah, that's right. Yep.
Uh, yeah.
Yep, that's right. So that, yeah.

Peter Wolf   41:41
And Brian, then we need to make sure that the make connection part is activated, the function's right.

Bryan Wolf   41:46
No, I'm a little confused. I'm a little confused. I don't. I don't really remember what what he's talking about. I'm not really not sure.

Peter Wolf   41:52
This is about, this is about the name on the repository, right? That we said, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   41:55
The database agent, Yep, the the data pooler. So I think on your chat it's data pooler. Yep, database pool or something.

Bryan Wolf   41:58
OK, OK, yeah.
It.

Lem Quimpo   42:07
Um.

Peter Wolf   42:07
Because then we said we could use this for a variety of different things. We were talking about using this for the flow analysis, the spreadsheet that we have that has outstanding flows, other flows we're considering building and whatnot. And all that's just kind of floating around and doesn't have a structured place, but this would allow US, to put it into a spreadsheet and I can.

Lem Quimpo   42:17
Yep.

Peter Wolf   42:23
Be talking with it to, you know, advance it or expand it or extend and put different flows In there or other topics, right?

Lem Quimpo   42:28
Yeah.
Yep, that's right. Yeah. Um.
And yeah, I think, uh, I wrote the.
Yeah, the documentation also is already.

Peter Wolf   42:43
And the first one was very basic. The first one was just the Gmail. When I send an article to myself or to the team that it would pick up and it would store it into a spreadsheet.

Lem Quimpo   42:49
Yeah, that that's.
Yep, that's right. This one the it's on #5. So this the documentation also for this is updated. Then yeah, the loom video is so we haven't really like updated this one.

Peter Wolf   43:06
I don't know anything with that. But now I'm thinking about it too. That would be a that would really be a a good if we took that and connected it In with the newsletter, right? Because if I said, well, I found an article that I'm interested in, I want to add it to the newsletter. I just emailed it to myself. I'm on my phone. I'm.

Lem Quimpo   43:18
Yep.

Peter Wolf   43:24
Scrolling whatever and I get an article. If I did that then we Can add it to the newsletter. But I guess right now it's just going to a spreadsheet. All I have to do is go to that spreadsheet, cut the URL and paste it into the newsletter URL. We could always link them together later, but right, that's all I have to do. I Can use that as a because we have manual input into the.

Lem Quimpo   43:37
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, that's right. Yep. But yeah, we we could actually easily like reroute the data there to the newsletter flow. So we just update the spreadsheet module there. So that's actually just a quick.

Peter Wolf   43:44
Newsletter, Correct. Right. OK.

Lem Quimpo   43:59
Uh, like a quick update.

Peter Wolf   44:01
Let's do that then. Let's do that. Let's add that in.

Lem Quimpo   44:02
Um.
Uh, OK, so uh, let's add. Uh, yeah, OK, we could do add the.

Peter Wolf   44:10
We'll link the output. This output should go into the newsletter into the newsletter spreadsheet.

Lem Quimpo   44:15
Yeah, the newsletter spreadsheet. And then, yeah, like another step, right, to also update the. OK, got it. So.
Yeah, we would need to reconnect this one I think, because we would need to add another module there on the.
Uh.
Let me just open this one.
I think this is on my end.
So I think we change your trigger to like research plus. Yeah, it's already research plus. Yeah, yeah. So what we can do here is we could just reroute. We would just add another module here.

Peter Wolf   45:14
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   45:23
To add a add a row and then we would just find the particular.
Particular spread. Yeah, the spreadsheet on the newsletter. So yeah, I need this newsletter process flow and then we we will just map it on the.

Peter Wolf   45:33
That workbook, that spreadsheet workbook.

Lem Quimpo   45:47
Uh.
This is like an article, right? Filtered articles. Yep. The only thing here is it's actually, I think, different from.

Peter Wolf   45:52
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   45:54
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   46:03
Our yeah we need to I think update this one. So because we have here the like a different prompt. So yeah the this particular prompt has like an angle on.

Peter Wolf   46:14
Summary or whatever.

Lem Quimpo   46:22
This is the for coming from Bart. The like the prompt is has an angle on the like the Treasury services. Yeah, yeah, the newsletter, but.

Peter Wolf   46:30
On the newsletter one, you're saying? Yeah, you know what? Let's I'm making this too complicated. Let's leave this out. If I have an article there, I Can go cut the URL, I Can paste it into the other and initiate. So let's not bother with it. Sorry. Should I go too far?

Lem Quimpo   46:34
Yep.
Yeah.
Yep. Yeah, because we we we would need here to also update I think the like the perplexity, perplexity 1 to have the like relevance and the summary angle something like that. So I think.
What I was, I what what I was thinking was it was just an overview but that that's not the it's not right because it was this is yeah this is already like the final content coming from Claude. So we yeah.

Peter Wolf   47:06
Hold one second.
OK, yeah, let's not, let's not worry about linking them together. Guys, I'll take this call. I'll be right back.

Lem Quimpo   47:13
Yeah.
OK, yeah, it was in updates.
What is this?

Bartosz Borek   47:54
Hey guys, I need, uh, 2 minutes as well. I'll be back In a second.

Lem Quimpo   47:59
You are up.
5.
I think it's got.
Sure.

Bryan Wolf   50:47
Then I'm going to need all these, because I think all my LinkedIn posts and stuff was on my other make account before we made the team one. I keep seeing them. I can't really like they're in some sort of separate account.

Lem Quimpo   50:56
Oh, OK.
Or the Jason file. You mean the Jason files? OK.

Bryan Wolf   51:06
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   51:09
OK, I'll I'll send this to you the.

Bryan Wolf   51:10
I think my Google connection might be a little wack too.

Lem Quimpo   51:14
Yeah, the Google Drive one.
I'm just, uh, input the images here first.
And yeah, I haven't updated actually the.
LinkedIn one yet.

Bryan Wolf   51:51
The actual process flow or like?

Lem Quimpo   51:55
Uh, no, the like the just the document. Yeah, the just the documentation, so.

Bryan Wolf   51:55
This is some of the documentation. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

Lem Quimpo   52:00
Uh, this this needs updating, so it's already different one.
Um.

Bryan Wolf   52:07
Which ones are already completely up to date? The newsletter?

Lem Quimpo   52:11
The newsletter. Also the database AI agent. The research on Inbox.

Bryan Wolf   52:16
Yeah.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   52:20
Um.

Bryan Wolf   52:21
Cool.
Let's check this one.

Lem Quimpo   52:26
Also this other one database.
Uh.

So that's updated also.
OK.
Um, yeah, let me just e-mail.
Oh.
Just create the new one.
LinkedIn content system.
Alright.
You could actually also. Oh, I'm not sure if, yeah, if that's already.
Updated. Yeah, I think it's not yet updated because I I also sent the I I also down uploaded the Jason files here on this Google Drive and you guys also have an access. But yeah, I think for the LinkedIn one still not up.
David, so I'll just e-mail it to you to be sure.
Uh.
Then.
Together with the database.
So.

Bryan Wolf   55:08
That's for. That's for make that you're sending me.

Lem Quimpo   55:12

Bryan Wolf   55:13
3.

Lem Quimpo   55:15
The Jason files.

Bryan Wolf   55:17
Yeah, you're saying they don't work?

Lem Quimpo   55:20
Nope. I what I mean is I already also put it on the Google drives here, but for the LinkedIn process flow, yeah, this is still not updated. So let me just yeah, you could also like download it here if you want.

Bryan Wolf   55:26
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, wow. Great.

Lem Quimpo   55:37
Yeah, so I also updated it here, but yeah, let me just delete this first so these are not updated.
And update. But yeah, I already sent you also the the updated ones, but yeah, this is also like you could reference it here on the future.

Bryan Wolf   55:50
Yeah.
Hmm.

Lem Quimpo   56:00

Bryan Wolf   1:13:30
Yeah, where it's pulling the data from.

Lem Quimpo   1:13:38
Where it's pulling this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:41
Yeah, okay. There we go. Good morning. There you go. Thanks.

Lem Quimpo   1:13:43
This one.
Oh yeah, uh, on the e-mail. I think I also sent you the link.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:50
Do you?

Lem Quimpo   1:13:52
The link on that link in process flow. Yeah, that's the yeah, you could just.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:56
Yeah, OK. No, no, no. Yeah, I already have this.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:00
OK, yeah, but but this is already updated one. So yeah, this is like a different from like the original one that yeah, we created.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:04
Me.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:12
So you could just uh like duplicate it also.
Oh.
Yes.
That's why.
For.
Yes.
The score.

Peter Wolf   1:17:16
Hey, sorry, my my daughter's moving into one of my apartments this morning. It's a little bit of chaos. I'm going to have to drop off. So we're we're updating documentation. Brian, you're putting this stuff for.

Lem Quimpo   1:17:19
That's for.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:17:36
I need to make sure everything's working in this environment. Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:36
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:17:41
Yeah, once we have that all set up, Bryan, everything's activated, I wanna walk through.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:45
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:17:49
I want to walk through each of the processes, right? I want to initiate them, make sure all the links are on, set up for my my accounts, my spreadsheets, my domain and all that kind of stuff, and then organize where we have everything.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:51
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:17:52
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:18:05
Yeah, then make sure we update the documentation appropriately. Hey, Bart, sorry to have kept you on here so long. I don't think there's anything really further right now. I think once we move into Microsoft environment.

Lem Quimpo   1:18:09
OK.

Bartosz Borek   1:18:13
Uh, multi tasking.
