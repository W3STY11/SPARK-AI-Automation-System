My dad.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

Lem   0:26
Yeah, that's good.
Yeah, because I think the if the e-mail is forwarded, it breaks the formatting breaks, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   0:34
Yes, I found that out too. 'cause I had forwarded it to Peter and it broke. So originally I thought it was outlook, but I I think it is just forwarding.

Lem   0:40
Yeah.
Yeah, it's the forward thing.
So yeah, it actually breaks the formatting. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   0:51
Format.
Yeah.
You were also waiting on here. I think Peter might be joining, if not just to us.

Lem   1:07
OK.
Yep, I also already updated the with the new sections and yeah, the trigger for the.

Bryan Wolf   1:13
Hello yeah.

'Cause Peter didn't join here in like a little later and just get started if you want.

Yeah, I actually already updated.
The.
Uh, yeah.
So the new.

Bryan Wolf   2:48
Sorry, go ahead.

Lem   2:49
Would be like this.
So all the same here on the first part, second, third part.

Bryan Wolf   2:54
Yeah.

Lem   2:56
And then social signals productivity.

Bryan Wolf   2:57
So what sections did you?

Lem   3:00
Yeah, so I've added formatting, so actually it will.
It's the formatting is good if we also arrange the formatting here, so if it's like this. So I yeah it would be formatted correctly if it's also formatted here.
So that's good.
And then yeah, so I've added this one, the serrala daily insights. So this is.

Bryan Wolf   3:26
OK.

Lem   3:27
Coming from.

Bryan Wolf   3:29
Zarella.

Lem   3:30
Yeah, from the website of, yeah, this one so.

Bryan Wolf   3:33
OK.
Yeah.

Lem   3:37
We just need to put a link here like the blog coming from Sarala and then click the.
Yeah. Click the whoops.

Bryan Wolf   3:45
Create summary.

Lem   3:49
Yeah, click the like the check mark here. So what?

Bryan Wolf   3:52
Yeah.

Lem   3:53
What it will do is it will automatically populate this like summary, blog content summary and then it will also get the title.
And then Yep, so.
That's good.
And then yeah, the conclusion.
So yeah, basically I've added this one and there's two new automations. This one number six and #7.
Web books. So this is actually the new interface on the spreadsheet wherein we will add an AI tool. So for example.

Bryan Wolf   4:29
OK.

Lem   4:31
Here on the AI tool like we will add a particular.
Like.
Link link to the AI tool or also yeah link I think.
Yeah, I've added a link.
So let's say we will add some link here.

Bryan Wolf   4:46
To what AI tool to like to like the ones that are listed in the section or my e-mail?

Lem   4:51
No, this is like.
Like a the one that we will choose. For example, we research some tools on finance and AI and then yeah, because yeah, Peter wanted to have something like he could add like an AI tool.

Bryan Wolf   5:02
Correct.

Lem   5:08
So for that one you would just put a link here the same as the like STS blog post and then click the particular.
Yeah, click the.
Click here as check Mark then.

Bryan Wolf   5:23
Yeah.

Lem   5:25
Yep.
And then it will generate that particular this one line summary and then also the name, name and title of that short name of title of the tool.

Bryan Wolf   5:35
OK.

Lem   5:36
Yeah. And then we could process that one for the newsletter.
So yeah, this is the. Yeah, other this one. And then the other one is. Yeah, this is for the STS blog post.

Bryan Wolf   5:44
That's great.
Mm hmm.

Lem   5:49
So I've added also the persona.

Bryan Wolf   5:50
So now on for the we have seven there 7.

Lem   5:52
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   5:55
So which ones did you change from the original 1?

Lem   5:56
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   5:58
Like like. So let me look at my. So like for out of out of numbers one through four or zero through 4.

Lem   6:03
Yeah.
One, yeah. The number one also, I've added it because this was consuming like lots of operations the past past design.
So this particular design is just consuming all the little operations.

Bryan Wolf   6:16
Huh.
Now that's for one or zero.
That's for one. OK here.

Lem   6:21
This is the number one. Yeah. #1. So yeah.
And then I've already removed the all articles because we have like the news new spreadsheet, right? The old article.

Bryan Wolf   6:30
Yeah.

Lem   6:30
So I yeah, we, I removed that one because it's costing too much operations.
And this number two also is new.

Bryan Wolf   6:37
Yeah, that one looks a lot different, yeah.

Lem   6:38
Yeah, because, uh, we've added a section.

Bryan Wolf   6:41
That looks a ton different.
Yeah. So each one of these is is the actual individual section of the of the of the e-mail.

Lem   6:43
And.
Yep, Yep, that's right.
So this one is for the intro for the new subsection, then this is the AI tools social media prompt of the day and STS blog post.

Bryan Wolf   6:51
Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.

Lem   6:59
And then it will.

Bryan Wolf   7:00
Correct.

Lem   7:01
The conclusion is here, so it will just process and take all of the variables here and then put it on a content.

Bryan Wolf   7:07
Ha.

Lem   7:08
So the content is this one, so I've mapped all of the like the variables.
To this particular formatting and then.
And yeah, so that we will get.
I think, yeah, this one.
So yeah, it's already formatted. A splint text here.
So we could just also like check this one like for the content and like the images and all. Yeah. And then Yep. So that's it.

Bryan Wolf   7:25
Mm hmm.
Thanks.

Lem   7:36
And then the number 5.
This is the the same. So yeah, this one is new. 1-6 and seven, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   7:43
AME.
Yeah. OK. OK.

Lem   7:45
#5.
Yeah, this is just the same.
So this is for the LinkedIn Reddit scraper and also the yeah, idols and all right.

Bryan Wolf   7:47
OK.
Can I see what the actual newslet looks like again?

Lem   7:56
Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's it's same here.
The newsletter.

Bryan Wolf   8:02
Yeah. Can I see what it looks like the new one?

Lem   8:06
Yeah, the new one is.
I've adjusted also the sizing because when I of the yeah of the this particular table because the last one is.

Bryan Wolf   8:10
Of the photos.

Lem   8:21
I think they send this.

Bryan Wolf   8:24
You sent me one last evening.

Lem   8:30
Yeah, it it was.

Bryan Wolf   8:31
This isn't.
This is. That's a new one, I believe, yes.

Lem   8:32
Yeah, this was bigger.
Yeah, it was wider.
So the photo also is bigger.
So what I did is I've adjusted the size of this one I the the width to make it smaller because so that the photos also will become smaller.
So yeah, now this is.

Peter Wolf   8:50
Yeah, but can't we can't. We still couldn't we just set the width for all the photos?
And I mean make them smaller, but they don't have to fill the whole frame there because they're they're just taking up too much space.

Lem   8:59
Yeah.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   9:03
I'm OK if they don't go side to side for the complete size, right?

Lem   9:05
Yeah, just in the middle, right?
Yep, yeah, I think.
Yeah, I would adjust that one because for example, this one also is small, so it's not.
Picking up big space.

Peter Wolf   9:18
I like that though.
That obviously look really good.

Lem   9:21
Yeah, yeah, this is just a big.

Peter Wolf   9:22
I think we can narrow the pictures to be, you know, half the size of the width, half the size of the width, right?

Lem   9:25
Yeah, it's smaller.
Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   9:30
Because the other thing is we're still having a problem when it goes to outlook, it gets really screwed up.

Lem   9:31
Right now.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   9:37
The the top one has a fixed size, but all of a sudden they say what?

Bryan Wolf   9:38
So it's just, it's just when you format, I think it's just when you forward it.

Lem   9:41
I think yeah, when we forward it, it actually breaks the formatting.
But if I I've actually sent you guys the e-mail.

Peter Wolf   9:49
Can you do me a favor?
Len, can you put both my e-mail addresses on your process when you're testing and you're producing them?
They're going to my outlook and my Gmail so I can see how they're showing up in my folders.

Lem   10:04
Yep.
For the I've actually added you guys on the.

Bryan Wolf   10:10
Hi.

Lem   10:11
Brevo test, but I'm not sure if it was sending.
Did you guys receive like the test?

Peter Wolf   10:16
Let me let me see.
I'll look but add my outlook there, not just my Gmail.
Add my outlook, OK.

Lem   10:22
Oh, OK.
Yeah, outlook, the one with.

Peter Wolf   10:25
Yeah, my peter.wolf@serrala.com.

Lem   10:28
Oh, OK.
Yeah, I'll add this that one.
So let me just check.
The.
Uh, this one.
Order.
So I'm yeah, I'm.
Sure, if.
Sending also to you guys the best not sure if.
Yeah, it I actually send a test e-mail and also like the campaign I send it, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   11:02
Do I get this?
So do I get this test on my e-mail or on my Bravo account?

Lem   11:08
On yeah, on your.
Oh, I'm sorry this time on your e-mail.
So you would be actually get.

Bryan Wolf   11:17
From you last night I got 3/3 of the. I think you forwarded to me or I think it was.

Lem   11:20
Oh, OK, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   11:23
Is this right after I asked you for?

Lem   11:24
Yeah, I think the test 1.

Bryan Wolf   11:26
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   11:26
Yeah, I think it.

Bryan Wolf   11:28
'Cause I needed Peter, so I was like urging urgent. And you sent it.
Oh, no, I think I got two test 1.

Peter Wolf   11:34
Oh, here. I got one Tuesday. This was yesterday one.

Bryan Wolf   11:37
Yeah, 12471240. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   11:41
Pm OK, so this came.
I got one that came from me. It says from AirDrop dot zones.

Lem   11:46
Yeah, that one. Yep.

Peter Wolf   11:48
So hold on me.

Lem   11:49
Is that the is that?

Bryan Wolf   11:50
Oh, no. I got yeah, yeah.
So yeah, anyway.

Lem   11:52
So there's also a difference on the.
This one so this if it's actually like this.
So if there's like.
A test newsletter.

Peter Wolf   12:03
Yeah, test OK.

Lem   12:04
Yeah, this is.
This is the test, but this one with like.

Peter Wolf   12:08
Let me share my screen.
Let me share my screen.

Lem   12:11
Serrala yeah.

Peter Wolf   12:11
This is one that came.
This is one that came directly from AirDrop zone, OK.

Lem   12:14
OK.

Peter Wolf   12:18
You see the can you see my screen?

Bryan Wolf   12:21
The formatting.

Lem   12:21
Yep, Yep.

Peter Wolf   12:22
Right. So we see already.

Lem   12:24
Uh.

Peter Wolf   12:24
This is. I'm gonna. I'm gonna let me just put it on my small screen and just say I know it's and I can't see it. Hold on.

Bryan Wolf   12:28
Microsoft.

Lem   12:30
Oh yeah.

Peter Wolf   12:32
Yeah. So so already.
I mean this is let's say this is.
I'm just looking at sizing.
This is about normal size on the on my on my standard PC about the size of my.

Bryan Wolf   12:45
Hmm.

Lem   12:46
Hmm.

Peter Wolf   12:46
It would open up right and if you look at this, look what happens here. Look at how big this is compared to that, right?

Lem   12:48
Yeah.
Yeah, the photo.

Peter Wolf   12:54
So every one of these somehow is just massive, and then it goes back down.

Lem   12:55
Oh, it's actually.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   13:00
So it has some sizing here that's predefined and for some reason.
It disregards that, and it's expanding this photo and whole section to be that much.

Lem   13:07
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   13:09
Bigger, so we need to do something that it says this is not forward.

Bryan Wolf   13:10
Is this? Could I forward it to you though?

Peter Wolf   13:14
This came directly from Serrala newsletter from automation AirDrop.

Lem   13:16
Yeah, this is.

Bryan Wolf   13:16
OK. Yeah.

Lem   13:17
I think this is on, yeah, on outlook, right.

Peter Wolf   13:19
Do we need to?
We need to get this figured out.
And and again, I would prefer that these even be smaller so that we predefined them to fit inside a a tighter window. The the top one, that's good.
I like that right again.
This probably won't be the end when we have, but I like if the top one filling up the full breadth.
But these these can be smaller so that they're smaller, you know, top to bottom too.

Lem   13:40
Yeah, it's actually.
The the format on yeah, outlook I think is different.
So I might.
Yeah. Let me check this out now.
Hmm.
Yeah, because it's it looks different on Gmail, so that's.

Peter Wolf   14:09
Yeah.

Lem   14:11
Yeah, we need to find.

Peter Wolf   14:11
But let's try.
Let's try somehow fixing the size of those instead of saying to make them go out to the edges that exist, let's set some smaller size, say not to exceed certain number of pixels wide, and make that half the size of what we have set for the broader right.

Lem   14:21
Yeah.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   14:28
So whenever we have for the articles as the width in the HTML, let's do half that for the photo and make it just center justified.

Lem   14:32
Yep.
Yeah. For the photo. Yep.
Yeah, I think I would need to, yeah.
Because the outlook is not reading the HTML code correctly.
So I might.
Yeah, I think I it has different formatting.
Yeah, I think I could try to.
Yeah, I'll try to test it now with.
The.
I'll try to copy the all the.
Format code and.
Feed it to chat G chat gptf.
Because it's has a different formatting.
So that.
123.

Peter Wolf   16:52
Interesting. I don't see any of the test ones in my P9 Wolf 9 e-mail.

Lem   16:53
Yeah.
On Gmail.

Bryan Wolf   17:00
I've got 2.
I've got no outlook.
I've got two and three in my outlook.

Lem   17:07
Oh, on outlook, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   17:08
I've got one final copy and 1:00.
At 2 chats.

Peter Wolf   17:19
And also got some error message encountered Erin in new in Oregarder RSS feed select top three create newsletter content Google Docs scenario.

Bryan Wolf   17:30
Is that for?
Is that for make or for yeah make make make just. I think we have to kind of subscribe and this you want to get the updates because if something goes wrong or not even something goes wrong.

Peter Wolf   17:32
Yeah, yeah, it's from make.

Bryan Wolf   17:43
It's just like sometimes it'll do like an error if I'm like when we're just trying things out, try to build, it'll spam.

Peter Wolf   17:49
But you're saying that the Eno reader, or to make we already have a subscription to make.

Bryan Wolf   17:53
Well it.
It's it's a. It's a e-mail from me, right that you're getting.
So I think a lot of those times it's like really, really delayed.
Messages about.
Whatever process flow.

Peter Wolf   18:05
Send this to you and you troubleshoot it.
Find out exactly what it was. So we again it says aborted here so.

Bryan Wolf   18:11
I don't think.
Yeah, it's it's probably just from like us running it and stopping it like it's it's not.
It shouldn't's me.

Peter Wolf   18:17
OK, but this this happened at 4:00. Four o'clock yesterday afternoon.

Bryan Wolf   18:17
I'll look it up, it tells me.
Yeah, I mean.

Peter Wolf   18:25
Here I'm going to send it to you via. You can troubleshoot it, right?

Bryan Wolf   18:27
I was, yeah, sure.
I don't think there's anything wrong with the video.

Lem   18:37
Yeah, I think.
Yeah, let's try this one out.
So I've just fed fed all the HTML code to ChatGPT and like turn it to an outlook friendly.
So yeah, and I think this this should I.

Bryan Wolf   18:56
Mm hmm.

Lem   19:00
I'll try to test it right now with.

Bryan Wolf   19:02
Great.

Peter Wolf   19:05
Can you share your screen while you're doing that, Lynn?

Lem   19:07
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   20:39
So we've got like 30 some articles from this morning.

Peter Wolf   20:43
Did we?

Bryan Wolf   20:44
And so it's like 376 to 340 something.

Peter Wolf   20:49
Right, but it shouldn't.
We shouldn't get 30 some article 30 unless it's in the first step.

Bryan Wolf   20:53
Oh, hold on.
Maybe I'm reading the date wrong?
This is the publication date actually, so I don't know but.

Bryan Wolf   24:47
Did you copy the code?

Lem   24:49
The.

Bryan Wolf   24:50
For like all 7 flows for the formatting on outlook. Or is there just one specific flow in there that controls the the formatting right there?

Lem   24:56
Yeah, yeah.
The Yeah, this just this particular.

Bryan Wolf   24:59

Formatting each time of code here.
And yeah.

Bryan Wolf   25:21
So in the prompt there you just put Jason code.

Lem   25:25
The HTML code.

Bryan Wolf   25:25

It looks actually this one so.

Bryan Wolf   25:37
Yeah. Is that not Jason?

Lem   25:38
Yeah, this one.
Nope, this is HTML. So it's like a different language.

Bryan Wolf   25:43

Peter Wolf   27:59
Yep, hold on. I'm waiting.

Lem   28:04

Peter Wolf   28:43
See. Hold on. I'm checking my.

Lem   28:45
OK.

Peter Wolf   28:47
Spam folder. I don't see anything.

Lem   28:58
Because I've actually added.
I think I'll just send this campaign so that.
So it's not.
Hmm.
Wonder where it's at.
Sending.

Bryan Wolf   29:24
Is it a brevo issue or play brevo sometimes a little bit of it's a little slow.

Lem   29:26
Yeah, I think it's.

Bryan Wolf   29:29
It's a nice little slow thing's firing.

Lem   29:32
Yeah, especially for like free plans that. Yeah, they. It's like they're not prioritizing.

Bryan Wolf   29:37
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   29:39
So what does it cost?
What's the cost of this? If I pay the pay plan?

Bryan Wolf   29:42
Yeah, it's not a lot.
It's not a lot, you know.

Lem   29:45
Yeah, I think 9.
$9, I think per month 999.

Bryan Wolf   29:47
It's not.

Peter Wolf   29:48
OK, let's Brian, let's just make it a paid plan.

Lem   29:53
Yeah. Let me send it to our e-mail. So it just says try to send this one.
So this is the outlook.

Bryan Wolf   30:01
And you don't want me to use Google, right?

Peter Wolf   30:04

Bryan Wolf   30:06

Lem   30:09

Lem   30:25
So this is the.

Bryan Wolf   30:27
Look, I got other ones for you.
I got 3 yesterday from you.

Lem   30:31
Yeah, this this is just like a little slow for.
Sending of complaints.
Yeah, but it's already running.

Yeah. Just sent. Yeah, it.
Oh, I actually send it to you guys on. Yeah, June 25.
So it's actually clicked.

Bryan Wolf   31:02
I know I'm not getting it.

Lem   31:02
Uh.
From yeah. From Peter.

Bryan Wolf   31:05
Mine's not populating either.

Lem   31:07
This one.

Bryan Wolf   31:08
No.
No, it's not my e-mail.

Lem   31:10
Oh.

Peter Wolf   31:10
Hold on.
Not to my not to my outlook.
Hold on.

Bryan Wolf   31:17
Well, that says your surround.

Lem   31:17
This is.

Peter Wolf   31:18
Can I see?

Bryan Wolf   31:18
That's your sherali, man.

Lem   31:20
This.

Peter Wolf   31:20
That that's what I meant. Not to my serrala outlook, right.

Bryan Wolf   31:21
That is, that is.

Peter Wolf   31:23
I created a rule for my newsletter so I can see the ones I got on Tuesday the 24th.

Lem   31:23
Oh, this is not the Sir.

Peter Wolf   31:30
I see that I put them into a unique folder coming from ikiji.

Lem   31:31
Umm.
Oh.
Yeah, that one.

Peter Wolf   31:37
I.
KIG AI automation, right?

Lem   31:39
Yeah. Yeah, that's that's right.

Peter Wolf   31:39
But they're they're coming into my P.
9 Wolf and I, but only as of yesterday.
I have them in the afternoon, right?
My afternoon. So 12:00 to 1:00 in the afternoon.
And then.
When I look at my.
There we go.
Finally, just got him 931.
I just got them in two of them.

Lem   32:05
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   32:07
So then let's see what happens when I download the picture.
Interesting. I downloaded the picture and it.
It didn't up there it goes.
Hold on.

Bryan Wolf   32:20
Yeah.

Lem   32:28
I think it already. Yeah, it's just.

Peter Wolf   32:31
So these these look, this looks much better.
Let me share my screen.

Lem   32:35
OK.

Peter Wolf   32:36
Hold on a second.
So this this size wise is very nice.
It's narrower. Before it was like this whole screen, right?

Bryan Wolf   32:54
Oh, you got it, OK.

Peter Wolf   32:54
So now can you see?

Bryan Wolf   32:57
Yeah, exactly.

Peter Wolf   32:58
So before it was, it was much like I look on this on my smaller computer screens and this is this is great, right?
It's narrower here.
It's not as overwhelming. Top to bottom. You go down here. This is, you know, this is still larger.
It's going.
And then, but now the whole thing is narrower.

Lem   33:11
Yep.

Peter Wolf   33:13
So it controls that this this looks good to me.
Me this looks really good.

Lem   33:18
Yeah, yeah, I'll just adjust the. Yeah, the photo.
I think we can, yeah, because.

Bryan Wolf   33:25
I think sometimes it's hard because the photos are so just big in general, like at least for the for all one. That's more of a banner. It's more, you know, rectangular versus ones are squares. If if you're going to keep shrinking them, it's going to shrink the the.

Peter Wolf   33:34
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   33:37
The format of or? I mean it would just, you'll just have more white area on the on the borders, you know.

Peter Wolf   33:39
Yeah, but, but so that's what I'm saying.
Can't we do that?
Can we do that independent of changing the size here like this size right now?

Lem   33:46
Yeah, I think.

Peter Wolf   33:46
I think this is terrific. If I looked at this, let me look on my phone, see how it looks on my phone.

Bryan Wolf   33:48
Yeah.

Lem   33:50
Uh.
Check.
Where's that again?

Peter Wolf   33:59
The only thing is on my phone this looks.

Lem   34:00
The.

Peter Wolf   34:03
Kind of small but but still really pretty good.

Lem   34:06
And slur.

Peter Wolf   34:07
My eyes are bad, but even with my eyes I can see it.
So what did you adjust here?
What was the sizing you adjusted, you know or you just ran through ChatGPT and told it to optimize for?

Lem   34:18
Yeah, I run it to ChatGPT and then told it to.
Change the format to outlook, Outlook HTML code.
So yeah, and then I've checked it.
Yeah, it's actually like different. Like, this is like the without the CSS CSS code.
So yeah, it's that's why it's actually.

Peter Wolf   34:39
This is the stuff you definitely need to play around with bride, right?
Again, I told you, you gotta get used to playing around and getting comfortable with that.

Bryan Wolf   34:42
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem   34:42
It's actually longer.

Peter Wolf   34:47
Let me see if I have this folder here start import.

Lem   34:48
A party.
Uh Precon test edit design so.

Peter Wolf   34:57
Is better.

Lem   35:04
Yep.
And then yeah, I.

Peter Wolf   35:08
Can you resend this one you just sent to outlook to to the Gmail? Because like the last version you sent to Gmail, this is a shame.

Lem   35:14
Gmail.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   35:18
It's like this from yesterday is perfect on the phone, so it looks terrific on the phone.
And the one today, let me just go back over here.
On the outlook, it looks it's a little too small.

Lem   35:33
Umm.

Peter Wolf   35:35
There's space.
We could definitely go larger on and I know it's hard.
We're optimizing across platforms, right?
But I think we can find something that's going to be in the middle ground here.
So if it was, if we went a little bit bigger than what we said here, but I think we can focus on the images should be smaller, right?
The the packaging the the, the the perimeter of each of the sections.

Lem   35:56
Yeah, the images.

Peter Wolf   36:01
Should be predefined. I think between whatever it was yesterday in the in the one you sent 2024 and the what you sent today should be a sweet spot.

Lem   36:03
Section 1.

Bryan Wolf   36:13
No, I think the one I just got one right now and 9:35 on my and on my phone.

Peter Wolf   36:16
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   36:19
It looks perfect.
It looks perfect.

Peter Wolf   36:21
The 935 one.

Bryan Wolf   36:21
You're saying the text?
You're saying the text might be a little too small.

Peter Wolf   36:24
You. Yeah, but you looking at, are you looking at it in in Gmail or in Outlook?

Bryan Wolf   36:28
In Gmail.

Peter Wolf   36:30
Yeah. So I didn't get that one in Gmail.

Bryan Wolf   36:32
Hold on.
Let me look at my outlook right now.

Lem   36:42
Then let's see triangle 400.
And then.
Ah.
600.
Say 80%.
It's just a different one image source.
Yeah, with auto order.
Border.

Bryan Wolf   37:40
So in outlook it looks the same for me.
It looks good.

Lem   37:43
20PX.

Bryan Wolf   37:45
On my phone.

Lem   37:47
With.
Yeah. Uh.

Bryan Wolf   37:53
Maybe a little too small, but.
Yeah, probably a little too small.
Text watch.

Lem   38:08
Do you?
420 Mark St.
Wait for 20 minutes here.
Let's try this one.
Oh *****.
Locksmith.
I thought the.
Axel.
Ha.
All the land also should be.
Yes.
Forget test.
Send test.

Peter Wolf   40:08
Hey, Bri. Forward me your your one for that you got in Gmail.

Bryan Wolf   40:14
Yeah, well it forward and ruins it, remember?

Peter Wolf   40:19
If you what?

Bryan Wolf   40:20
When you forward it.

Peter Wolf   40:21
Now the one you got this morning that that so just forward it to my Gmail, I want to see I didn't even get it in my Gmail.
Hold on a second.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

Bryan Wolf   40:28
Now I'm saying when you forward the when you forward any of the newsletters, it corrupts the the formatting of it and I don't even have one on my Gmail.

Lem   40:28
Wolf.

Peter Wolf   40:31
You're saying it gets screwed up, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   40:36
They're all on my outlook, but I was just actually looking at 1:00.

Peter Wolf   40:40
And you're saying, when you look at it looks fine, but isn't it less than the full width of your screen?

Bryan Wolf   40:44
So I I think the text like the actual text content might be a smidge too small.

Peter Wolf   40:51
You're not seeing pictures.

Bryan Wolf   40:53
The pictures I see it are great the Gray size, but here I can just show you on my phone.
Really, I think I can.

Peter Wolf   41:01
Yeah. Can you share your screen?

Bryan Wolf   41:03
I don't know if I can share my screen. Let's see.

Peter Wolf   41:05
Yeah, Kay, do that.
We do FaceTime with screenshot.

Lem   41:07
It's one.

Bryan Wolf   41:07
I probably could.
Oh, you know what?
I could do this.
I could switch the teams on my phone here. Hold on.

Lem   41:14
Launch camera.

Peter Wolf   41:16
Just based on me and share your screen.

Bryan Wolf   41:18
Yeah. OK.

Lem   41:20
Umm.
Con.
And then.
Change this.
OK.

Peter Wolf   41:47
I saw some come up saying Sharon scream, but I didn't click it. It disappeared.

Bryan Wolf   41:50
Hold on, let it. Let it sit. Let it sit.

Lem   41:52
I see.

Bryan Wolf   41:53
You should see my screen now.

Peter Wolf   41:53
My screen now.

Lem   41:59
I order reply too.

Bryan Wolf   42:00
Janet.

Peter Wolf   42:00
Jenna. Not yet.
Again I it showed me something like it was gonna share the screen, but then it it like quickly disappeared.

Bryan Wolf   42:07
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   42:16
Let me try and there we go, share started screen sharing, OK.

Bryan Wolf   42:18
MMM.

Peter Wolf   42:21
But why don't I see it?

Bryan Wolf   42:23
OK.
Why don't see it?

Peter Wolf   42:25
It says you're sharing.

Bryan Wolf   42:26
And scaring me. Hold on. Hold on. I'll just.
One second one.
Change.

Lem   43:38
Then.

Bryan Wolf   43:39
She helps me out with it out.

Lem   43:41
Why does it have a border?

Bryan Wolf   43:46
Wanna look on?

Lem   43:47
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   44:06
Vicky, look on, look on these teams.

Peter Wolf   44:10
On teams.

Bryan Wolf   44:11
This is on my phone.
Yeah, I'm sharing my screen.

Peter Wolf   44:13
Hold on.
I don't know if that's gonna reflect really exactly what it would look like.

Bryan Wolf   44:20
Well, look, look.

Peter Wolf   44:22
I'm I'm going, Brian.
And that's you sharing your phone.

Bryan Wolf   44:35
Are you on teams, on your phone or on your computer?

Peter Wolf   44:36
Yeah, I am.
I'm saying you're sharing that from your phone.

Bryan Wolf   44:39
Yes, yes.

Peter Wolf   44:41
OK.
So let me share mine from my phone 'cause that looks like it's a full size of your phone, right?

Bryan Wolf   44:46
Yeah, it is.

Peter Wolf   44:47
And that's from Gmail, not outlook or that's outlook.

Bryan Wolf   44:47
This is on my outlook too.
No, this is this is outlook.

Peter Wolf   44:51
OK.
Look at when I share mine.

Bryan Wolf   44:52
I don't have one in January.

Peter Wolf   44:55
How do you? Let's see.
I go share mine.

Lem   45:19
Image source.
And then.
60.

Peter Wolf   45:42
So now if I go to my.
E-mail.
So here it is.
Can you see my screen?
You see how much space there is on the right hand side.
See how I can how much space I go back and forth there.
Mine doesn't fill out the full screen, but yours does.
I can read it, but it's small.
So that's fine if yours is coming through.

Bryan Wolf   46:14
Sorry, I was on mute.
This is this is Gmail.

Peter Wolf   46:17
This is no this is outlook.

Bryan Wolf   46:19
So I don't know why you're still stripping my mine looks great.
Mine looks like regular clothes out.

Peter Wolf   46:23
Yeah, I agree. I agree.
So what we need to do is we'll just, we'll we'll stick with this and we'll send it to a bunch of people and we'll see what they, you know, how it turns out for their their, you know, phone and their PC, et cetera, right.

Bryan Wolf   46:39
Mm hmm.

Peter Wolf   46:45
All right, so let's let's move forward.

Lem   46:45
Uh.

Peter Wolf   46:46
Let me got hold on a second.

Lem   46:49
OK.
Yeah, I'm actually.
Yeah, editing it on.

Bryan Wolf   46:55
Unshare your screen.

Peter Wolf   46:57
OK.
Thanks rye.

Lem   46:59
Let me just.

Bryan Wolf   47:00
Yeah.

Lem   47:04
Share my.
Yes. So I'm trying to like edit the like the coding here on Bravo. And Yep, I think I I was able to like put it like this one.

Peter Wolf   47:24
Yeah, I don't.
You're not sharing anything, man.

Lem   47:24
So yeah.

Bryan Wolf   47:26
Yeah.

Lem   47:27
Oh.
Yep, let me just.
Obviously the chain again.
Share screen OK.
Yeah. So, yeah, basically, yeah, I've added it would look like this, it's much smaller.

Peter Wolf   47:53
Yeah, I like that.
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

Lem   47:56
Yeah. OK.

Peter Wolf   47:57
So can you show us like where you did that?

Lem   47:58
Yep.

Peter Wolf   47:59
Show us in the HTML code or where you manage that so Brian can see that.

Lem   48:04
So it's actually here on the this one.
So this is yeah, this is the particular like image link.

Bryan Wolf   48:08
Tell me what?

Lem   48:13
So this is the image link.
So and then this is the.

Peter Wolf   48:17
So like Brian, this is where I would see you taking the HTML text here. The code plugin that I did and saying hey if I'm trying to change the size of the picture, yeah, where what, what's the lines of code that tell me to change the the size?

Bryan Wolf   48:23
Yeah.

Lem   48:23
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   48:24
And just tweaking around, yeah, yeah.

Lem   48:26
Yep.
Yes, that's right.

Peter Wolf   48:31
Of the picture and you just got to get comfortable with this, right?

Lem   48:32
Yep.

Peter Wolf   48:34
Because you got to be able to say that you understand how to use chat, GBD, to to manipulate this stuff.

Lem   48:36
Yeah.
Yeah. Also can as you can see here I I've added my first prompt here is yeah this one.
Can you edit this HTML code and make it for Outlook e-mail format?
And then I've just pasted the whole code here on the prompt on ChatGPT and.

Peter Wolf   48:54
Yeah.
Yeah, that's where you got to be playing around with Brian.
The test box right. OK.

Lem   48:59
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   48:59
I do.
I do.

Lem   49:01
Then it. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   49:01
I'm just. I think I'm just giving guidance, OK.

Bryan Wolf   49:03
No, no, no, it's not.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm watching like a aspirin.
I'm just saying.

Lem   49:06
Yeah. And then yeah, it was able to also.
Output the code and then I've added another.
Next is I've added here.
Can you?
As you can see this one can you change the size of the images on the subsections to be 30.

Peter Wolf   49:21
Yeah. Perfect.

Lem   49:22
Yeah, 30% smaller.

Peter Wolf   49:23
Yeah, that's the kind of iterative you got to do with it, Bry.

Lem   49:24
Yeah, yeah.
So yeah, ChatGPT is already like intelligent enough.

Bryan Wolf   49:26
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   49:27
And so he's not even doing the code right?

Lem   49:29
Yep, Yep.

Peter Wolf   49:30
I mean, he's putting it in saying, hey, make these adjustments. What?

Bryan Wolf   49:30
Well, he does the original one I think, right.

Lem   49:33
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   49:35
Like Shaolin, are you building out the flow in make and then exporting the file and then plugging in?

Lem   49:36
Yep.

Peter Wolf   49:43
He just cut this component. This particular steps prompt where it had the code he's saying, hey, manipulate this code for me and then he's updating the prompt.

Bryan Wolf   49:46
Right, right.
Yeah, yeah.

Lem   49:54
Yeah.
But first, because it was like a different code, so you would just need to like up like first let's say make like a like like first section.
And then you could just add like iterate it here on ChatGPT and then.
Yeah, because for like, yeah. For the last time.
It actually just.
Added some like.
Basic coding and then I put it to ChatGPT to make it more like more beautiful.
So that's why I added a different actually different with the CSS code, not just this one.

Bryan Wolf   50:38
Mm hmm.

Lem   50:40
Yeah, because this is actually a different structure than the like the other one, the other formatting.
But yeah, so.
And then yeah, for the testing. Also sometimes I just look at here on and.
Just test the size.
So for example like sizing here.

Bryan Wolf   51:06
Mm hmm.

Lem   51:09
For example this one.
So this was the particular.
Link. So this was the link right?
So I just tested it.
This was ChatGPT input here like 480 I think 480 pixels.

Bryan Wolf   51:23
Yeah.

Lem   51:24
So I've yeah, I've just played around with it and then also added the border 8 radius, this one so that it would have like.

Bryan Wolf   51:34
Now with this this is this is for the whole newsletter or so when you're going flow by flow, exporting the each file and plugging them in one by one or what are you doing because there's seven.

Lem   51:36
A like a border.
Uh.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   51:49
There's seven process flows that build up to it, so.

Lem   51:50
Yeah, yeah. And I'll be, yeah. Basically I just add, just copy paste it because like the.
The formatting.

Bryan Wolf   52:00
For all seven at once, though, I'm saying like so, like.

Peter Wolf   52:03
Yeah, but look. But he's look at his thing.
He's already gotten the subsection, so their subsection 1, subsection 2OK.

Lem   52:05
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   52:06
I am.
Listen, I'm not asking that, OK?
I'm asking him so for the he's getting that you're getting this code from the export file in make, right?
Like you go to the export file and make and that's where you're getting the the HTML right?

Lem   52:21
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   52:23
Or are you building HTML yourself like right here? When you go to export?

Lem   52:24
No, no. Yeah.
The HTML was yeah.

Bryan Wolf   52:28
Yeah.

Lem   52:28
So the H no, no the the HTML format is actually here on this.

Bryan Wolf   52:34
OK.

Lem   52:35
This one is actually built already by ChatGPT, but I've on the prompt.

Bryan Wolf   52:38
Right. So I'm saying, I'm saying if you go back to make go back to make right, so click on the three dots and that's the HTML, OK.

Lem   52:42
Yeah, this this is me.

Bryan Wolf   52:45
I'm thinking of the Jason files.

Lem   52:46
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   52:48
What I'm thinking of at the very bottom.

Lem   52:49
No, no, no.
The IT was different. Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   52:50
Right, the Jason file is just the output for the whole entire process, the whole chain.

Lem   52:53
Yeah. So this that was different.

Bryan Wolf   52:54
Yeah.

Lem   52:56
So yeah, it would be.

Peter Wolf   52:56
This is the structure of the e-mail.

Bryan Wolf   52:59
Yeah.

Lem   52:59
So yeah, this is the like particular structure.

Peter Wolf   53:01
S.

Lem   53:02
Yeah, I fed it to ChatGPT that it will create this structure and then I've I've added.

Bryan Wolf   53:02
Yeah.
No.

Peter Wolf   53:06
Right. But so this is not your output though, right?
This is what you put in to tell it to format the output from ChatGPT, but you use ChatGPT to write this code to be this format.

Lem   53:10
The yeah, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   53:12
Yeah. So yeah, yes.

Lem   53:14
Yep, that's right. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   53:17
To get the answer, yeah. Uh huh.

Peter Wolf   53:19
But this is you putting in.

Lem   53:20
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   53:22
This is how it should look when it comes out.

Lem   53:24
Yes, that's right. Yep, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   53:24
Yes.

Lem   53:26
So this this has the like for example this one the dynamic these are like dynamic values.

Peter Wolf   53:34
Predefined kind of functions that it knows to put in bullet point form. What that means?

Lem   53:34
They put the bullet formal.
Yep. Yeah, that's right.
And then I've just added a context here like create different table for every subsections together with image source citation like like that and then I've added.

Peter Wolf   53:46
Yeah, that's where you got to get used to Bryce. Those kinds of functions that are in there.

Lem   53:49
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   53:49
Yeah.

Lem   53:51
Like this one?

Bryan Wolf   53:52
The the purple ones you're saying?

Lem   53:54
Citation link.

Peter Wolf   53:54
No, the parts that he's got here in, like those brackets, those are like it's referencing different things. Put bullet point form and citation image source.

Bryan Wolf   53:58
Yeah, yes, yes, yes.

Lem   54:00
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   54:01
Well, I think that's good. 'cause Chechi will will kind of pick up the slack on that for me.
Chat GT will will help that instead of me.

Lem   54:06
So.
Yeah, but yeah, it would actually also pick this up from depending on the input data, because I've we we have.

Bryan Wolf   54:09
Just now I get off rope.

Peter Wolf   54:16
That was a variable, right?
Or something. It's a defined variable.

Lem   54:20
Yeah, we have the.

Peter Wolf   54:21
Not a make variable, but a variable somewhere where it knows that particular word of source media or source.
You know, it knows what that means to grab that from the output that was fed over from the previous step, from the from the Eno reader and the, and then the image generator.

Bryan Wolf   54:32
Mm hmm.

Lem   54:45
Yeah, well, I think.
This is the wrong one, yeah.
So yeah, this was the yeah.
So the format, yeah, the format here is actually.
Like.
Like a prebuilt this. This was the. Yeah, the right one.
And then, yeah, this one.

Peter Wolf   55:06
But pre built by you using ChatGPT to give you guidance and then you plugged it in here yeah.

Lem   55:10
Yep, that's right. Yep.
Yeah, for the like the formatting and then also, yeah, this is already the outlook one. Yeah. And then, yeah, I've, I've, I've added just added this like particular dynamic ones to the. Yeah. Like this one put the bullet bullet form hit list.
Then yeah, this one image source.
So yeah, but basically I didn't remap it.
But this ChatGPT would also be able to cross reference this because of our like the input, so the input data also as.
I will show you you already have.
That so?
It has like for example this one like intro bullet form list.
So this is the one that I'm cross referencing like subsection title, Citation Link, subsection content.
So these are the ones that I'm.
I'm actually splitting here.

Peter Wolf   56:14
Yeah.

Lem   56:15
Yeah. So that is the coming from the input data.
So if I put it different name here and then it the input data has a different name so it it won't be getting it correctly.
So that would like. Yeah. So yeah, that would also be, yeah, the the one to check the like, the dynamic ones should be crossreference and the same with.

Peter Wolf   56:28
Yeah, of course, right.

Bryan Wolf   56:29
Alright.

Lem   56:41
The with the ones on the text, the raw text, Yep.

Peter Wolf   56:43
OK, I have a call.
I have a call that starts in 3 minutes.

Bryan Wolf   56:44
No.

Peter Wolf   56:46
Can we can we?
Or 4 minutes.
Can we quickly see what other changes we made?
Did we make those other changes about other sections or the add-ons or what?

Lem   56:52
Uh.
I had for the other sections.
Yeah, I've added also.
This one, so the prompt is already good.
I mean the the formatting.
So we would just change the prompt. The formatting on the Google sheet, then it would be also the same.
And then if I.

Peter Wolf   57:16
Using a Google sheet input where we not the spreadsheet or something, we're referencing a Google sheet.

Lem   57:23
Yeah, basically because this one right, you have the prompt of the day.
This one it was like.

Peter Wolf   57:29
Yep.

Lem   57:32
Like it's like this. And then what I did?

Peter Wolf   57:34
So so we have to format it in the Google sheet.

Lem   57:38
Yeah. And then we could.
We cannot actually format it here like like put an in like a new line. So what?
I actually did.
Is just formatted it outside of, let's say outside of.
Outside of.

Peter Wolf   57:53
You actually can, if you do control you hold control and do a return, you'll get those line spacing.

Lem   57:59
Uh, control?
Is this on Mac or?

Peter Wolf   58:04
At least on Excel.
Maybe not in Google Sheets, but if you hold.

Lem   58:08
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   58:08
If you hold control and return inside a cell, it will return or if you try, try.

Lem   58:13
OK.

Peter Wolf   58:13
Yeah, try that.
Hold control and return.

Lem   58:16
Control.

Peter Wolf   58:17
It not doing anything.

Lem   58:19
And yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   58:21
So I don't know.

Lem   58:21
Is this same on Mac?

Peter Wolf   58:21
In Excel you can you can. You can add, you can add line spacings like that right.

Lem   58:24
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   58:27
Like a regular return.

Lem   58:27
Ah, OK.
Yeah.
So you.
Yeah, we you could.
We could just add there.
So what?
I just did.
I've added it on here and then I've added it on here on the on like a note.

Peter Wolf   58:36
In some other tool to put it and then cop it back with the spacing and put it back in, OK.

Lem   58:38
Yep, that's right.
Yeah, and. And then put it back in.

Peter Wolf   58:41
So we're gonna need to structurally make it put it in the cell with the structure already included, and then it will carry that structure out.

Lem   58:44
Yeah. Like that. Yeah, that's right.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   58:48
OK, good. OK.

Lem   58:48
Yep, that's right.
Yep, it will carry the structure.

Peter Wolf   58:51
That's that's one. What else did we have?

Lem   58:53
This one. So we have now the yeah, the blog post.

Peter Wolf   58:54
Blog post yeah.

Lem   58:56
So we would just put a link here, for example a link here and then click this one create summary from the blog post link and then it will.

Peter Wolf   59:00
Yep.
And that goes out to ChatGPT and and does a a blurb.

Lem   59:07
Yep, ChatGPT.
And that's the Yep, the blur, the summary and then also the title.

Peter Wolf   59:11
OK.

Lem   59:12
It will get and then.

Peter Wolf   59:13
We need to do a shorter blurb there, like similar to the articles. That's that looks way too long, right?

Lem   59:19
OK.
Yep, yeah. This pretty long. And then.
Also for the AI tools and updates now we could already add like a link.
So let's for example, you have like a tools or updates link that you want.

Peter Wolf   59:32
And we'll get a.
We'll get a little write up.
We execute it and it'll do a mini execution.

Lem   59:35
Yep.
Yep, that's right.
And then if we check this one, create one sentence so it will create the one sentence overview the same as this one and then also a title here.
So yeah, we could add it. And Yep, yeah, I think that's the one.

Peter Wolf   59:45
Awesome.
So I didn't see the the latest one you sent didn't have any of those in it. I don't think did it?

Lem   59:52
Oh, also.
Yeah. Yeah, I just.

Peter Wolf   59:57
Scroll down a little bit.

Lem   59:58
I just created it today.
This one, the new ones.

Peter Wolf   1:00:02
Oh, OK.

Lem   1:00:03
Yeah, I just created this today and also for the.

Peter Wolf   1:00:05
Can you guys? I'm gonna drop off to this other call, but can we shorten up the blurb on the blog?

Bryan Wolf   1:00:07
No.

Lem   1:00:11
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:00:11
And again, I hope we're using the Persona thing right. I think we really should be using the same the same steps as we do for the article to, say, write a fifty word blog, whatever that parameter is with the the input of the persona stuff, then if you.

Lem   1:00:14
Yeah. Yeah, it's.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:00:27
Produce a new one.
Send it both to my Gmail and my outlook so I can see it with all these component pieces in.

Lem   1:00:31
OK.
OK, copy.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:33
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:00:34
OK, I gotta drop off to this other call. And Brian, you just need to keep working through all this stuff and getting insight etc, right?

Lem   1:00:37
I'll give you there.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:37
Play.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:00:41
OK. All right. See ya.

Bryan Wolf   1:00:41
Yeah, yeah, yeah. See ya.

Lem   1:00:42
Uh.
Umm, but where did this?
Oh, I write.
Coming here.
Yeah, and this is this blog post.
Yeah, I think I didn't add here the.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:07
The model.

Lem   1:01:08
Yeah. On the model like the parameter for.
Yeah, I just added.
This to the three paragraphs.
So maybe two paragraph.
This paragraphs.
Hold on.
Let's see 100.
Onwards in total.
Short and bungee.
Save.
And then Yep, I think we could trigger this one now.
So for the what I actually do for like just testing, we could actually copy this like hook and then I'll just open it on another browser.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:06
Yeah.

Lem   1:02:12
And then this would actually.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:13
I love this browser isn't yeah, and says accept.

Lem   1:02:15
Yeah, it would.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:16
Is that what you're looking for?

Lem   1:02:17
Yeah, it would trigger that one.
The one this would hook.
So if I run this once, it will trigger, but I think I need to add it first.
The.
Oh, need to add it the yeah, this one.
So.
Let's check.
Oh, it will just I think auto populate this.
Yep, I think it will just auto populate.
So if you run it once, just existing data, so it will, yeah get that.
And then add it.
Oh, what happened?
Missing value parameter rule number.
Oh.
Odd.
Type the summary.
We didn't get the.
Right, because it's already.
It already has the summary.
So that was the.
This was the filter.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:42
Uh huh.

Lem   1:03:42
Let me just new.
Yeah, let's create the new one.
Lawrence.
I I'll I'll give you the this new because these are all did you already incorporated?

Bryan Wolf   1:04:00
Yeah.
All of them basically.
The one you sent me know.

Lem   1:04:05
The.
Yep, yeah, I think.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:08
No, it's in my file.
So should I just? So I'm wondering should I re just write over the ones that I already have or just?

Lem   1:04:10
Maybe.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:15
I mean, yeah, I figured out it's fine if you send them to me, I can. It's fine.

Lem   1:04:17
Yeah, because, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:19
I got just. I got to plug my my stuff into it again, but it's just totally over.

Lem   1:04:24
Yep, I think.
Yeah, you need need to because I've like tweaked some of the.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:30
Right. That's OK.

Lem   1:04:31
Yeah, except for #3 and number.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:34
I need this Google sheet too.
I need the Google sheet as well.
Or did you already send that to me?

Lem   1:04:38
Yeah, the Google sheet.
Yeah, this is.
Yeah, I send it also to you the I think yesterday.
Yep, but yeah, that would be.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:43
OK. Yeah.
I've got this zero trigger.

Lem   1:04:47
Yeah, already updated.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:49
No, I don't have it.
I don't have any shoot.
Or did you just want to my Gmail? No, no, no.

Lem   1:04:52
So I think this #3.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:58
'Cause I still I I'm actually I need everything I need.
And then zero to seven.
And the Google sheet.

Lem   1:05:14
This is the new one.
Yeah, I think this we need this to be shorter, I think.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:20
What this summary for black content?

Lem   1:05:21
The yeah, the summary or.
Yeah, maybe needs to be much shorter than that because it should be like the same.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:28
Oh gosh.
Yeah.

Lem   1:05:32
For the subsection, they actually didn't.
It's just one paragraph, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:05:40
So I got a question for you.
So I'm trying to do.

Lem   1:05:42
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:43
I've had trouble.
I've had problems with my LinkedIn posting flow.

Lem   1:05:48
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:49
That's honestly a share like like the whole one.
Do you care?

Lem   1:05:54
You'll you'll share your screen or OK, no problem.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:57
Yeah. So can you.
Yeah. So why is it that?
The summaries are laid out like this.
Is this something I can change it in?
Like the formatting one of these.
'Cause you saw me move this?
See how these are just so that happens.

Lem   1:06:13
Oh, that's odd. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:16
It usually doesn't happen like the first five usually work fine and then like the last couple are like that.

Lem   1:06:20
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:24
So I don't really know.

Lem   1:06:24
Well, I think it's on the prompt on.
The Yeah, this one on ChatGPT. So let I think.
Uh, just stop three articles.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:39
This one is.

Lem   1:06:42
Suggest.
The pre address uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:51
I can actually go in here and send an article here URL to company.

Lem   1:06:55
Oh, I think this is.
Yeah, this is the number one.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:00
Mm hmm, this isn't wrong.

Lem   1:07:00
And then yeah, this is just getting the.
Yeah, this is just getting the summary and URL and.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:08
See, but I don't see these on here, you know.
It's OK, 'cause. I'll have a good deal.

Lem   1:07:16
Oh, I think maybe it's on different spreadsheet.
Can you go back to that?

Bryan Wolf   1:07:21
Oh.

Lem   1:07:24
On the last one.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:28
****.
Oh.

Lem   1:07:39
Oh, it's.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:41
Sheet metal.
Article maybe something on here?
She's in top three.
These are the these are the top three to pick. But in all articles.

Lem   1:07:50
I think.
In all articles.
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.
So that is actually like the. Can you go back to the spreadsheet?
Yeah, that one.
Yeah, this is actually the summary that is coming from Ino reader.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:13
OK.

Lem   1:08:13
So yeah, basically, yeah, they actually have this particular.
What you call that like formatting for their?

Bryan Wolf   1:08:22
Where it's like PPP.

Lem   1:08:24
Yeah. Yeah, that's right. On the INA reader.
So it's coming from them.
But yeah, you could just like select.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:31
Copy and paste it.

Lem   1:08:33
Anoop just.
Because if you're bothered with.
The yeah, with the.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:41
I just want to be able to like read a short blurb right here 'cause I selected ten articles right like it, it shows 10.

Lem   1:08:45
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:49
I'm not writing it now, but like it it shows 10.

Lem   1:08:50
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:08:52
So instead of it just picking a three that I that it thinks I would like the most, which might be the best I wanna be able to go through and look like oh, what are the other you know, seven that I missed that were in there.

Lem   1:08:59
Oh, OK, yeah.
Yep, we could actually.
Can you click the like upper right of that tab?
Yeah, let's go back and then like the select all or we can. Yeah, the.
Like.
This the the one on the left, upper left on the D tree.
Can you see the D tree there's like?

Bryan Wolf   1:09:34
Dht 3.

Lem   1:09:35
Below that one.
So we're just selecting all of the columns and yeah, that one.
And then can you click the it's.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:40
Yes.

Lem   1:09:44
The one on the formatting of paragraph here on Nope.

Bryan Wolf   1:09:45
Copy.

Lem   1:09:51
The right. Yeah, the third one.
Third one.
Yeah, this one.
Text wrapping and then just click it.
Yep.
And then just click the third one also.
Yeah, that one clip. So it should clip and then?
Yeah. So we should also, I think this is on auto format also, so.
So.
Oh, can you double click the row between 1:00 and 2:00?
Just the like the line there, yeah.
So that it.
Yeah, that.
Yeah, just just move that one, OK.
Yeah. OK. OK.
Yeah, I think that's it.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:32
Oh wow.

Lem   1:10:32
Yeah. So that would be.
Yep, that's good then.
Now it's OK.
Now you can just like double click the particular summary.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:43
Can I get out of the highlighted section? Yeah.

Lem   1:10:44
Yeah, just get out of that. Yeah. So now you can just double click the. Yeah. OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:47
Oh, Lem, you're the man.
That's exactly what I need.

Lem   1:10:50
So yeah, that's easier to check, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:53
Nice. Yay. Yay. Yay, yay. Yay. Yay.

Lem   1:10:56
So yeah, this is yeah, this is formatting.

Bryan Wolf   1:10:57
You're great.

Lem   1:11:00
Yeah, this format is actually.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:00
Now listen, I don't, I don't.
I don't mind this like this 'cause. Now I can read it. I I just or even go to chatting team be like just put this in there.

Lem   1:11:06
Yep, yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:11
But so I do have one more problem and I know we have done this a million times, right?

Lem   1:11:17
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:18
So if I so I just ran this first one, right?
So I'm gonna go do I run the second one before I pick one of these or I press or like so this is for LinkedIn posting, right?
So I ran this one already.
Me.

Lem   1:11:31
OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:31
And none of these were on.
So should I run this one next or do I need to change LinkedIn first or the the spreadsheet first?
I can't remember.

Lem   1:11:41
You mean?

Bryan Wolf   1:11:41
It's it.
I run it.

Lem   1:11:43
Oh.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:44
So like do I run?
I run one and two and then I go to the spreadsheet and I press ready to post and then I run 3 right.

Lem   1:11:46
For.
Yep, that's right, because we didn't put the web book here yet. It's only.

Bryan Wolf   1:11:52
OK.
So here when I my my it's my Google Drive again.
It's the same thing telling you, see, it's it's the same thing. So says.
Invalid refresh token.
Does that mean that we? What does that mean?

Lem   1:12:09
Yeah, we need to like verify your again.
You can just go on the left side and then on the connections on make. Can you go back on make?

Bryan Wolf   1:12:20
All right, I remember, OK.

Lem   1:12:22
Yeah, the the more, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:22
Where is it? It's.

Lem   1:12:24
And then just on the connections, because sometimes yeah, like everyone week, it's just like needs.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:28
Ah yes.
Right, right.
Well, I I have. I changed my secret.
I changed my secret.

Lem   1:12:36
Oh, I see. Yep, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:36
So that's why that's why, that's why.
So you know what?
How do I go to that again right so.

Lem   1:12:44
Yep, here and then on the left side API.
And then.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:51
Oh ****, I didn't shave it, did I?

Lem   1:12:52
Oauth.
Think.

Bryan Wolf   1:12:58
Clients. Clients.

Lem   1:12:59
Clients. Clients. Yep.
Then yeah, this one. That's good.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:02
Oh, I've got look. OK, OK, OK.
So so I don't know which one this is, to be honest with you.
So I'm gonna delete all of them.

Lem   1:13:08
Yeah, just delete it so that you can put another and then just put naming name it.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:14
The real one, the newest one.

Lem   1:13:16
Yeah, the new one.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:16
The best one?
Yes.
OK.
Is there a reasonable delete?
We cannot because it because of what?

Lem   1:13:33
Yeah. It's just I think it's.
Yeah, there's just some.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:37
It's just glitching.

Lem   1:13:38
Yeah, it's just delay. There's some delay.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:40
Well, this this one won't delete.

Lem   1:13:43
Oh, I think because it has.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:45
It might be the best one.

Lem   1:13:46
It has your.
It's using.
It's being used on like different automations.
That's why you can just, I think verify this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:54
So that's the that's the one.
That's, that's the one.

Lem   1:13:56
Yeah, you can just reauthorize or verify this one.

Bryan Wolf   1:13:57
How do I verify?

Lem   1:13:59
But yeah, I think this is the correct one.
Yeah, this is really good.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:13
Oh well, these are these.
These are all ones that stop working. Is what you're saying? All these reauthorized ones?

Lem   1:14:19
The.
The yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:21
Everything that says reauthorized doesn't work anymore.

Lem   1:14:25
I know it's still working, but yeah, sometimes they just put it there.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:29
I just need a little refresh, yeah.

Lem   1:14:30
Yeah, this those are being used. The ones that I have reauthorized.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:34
OK. OK. OK.

Lem   1:14:36
It has.
It's being used by the automation.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:39
So now let's try this out now.
Yeah. So I'm just gonna have to.
I'm just gonna have to.

Lem   1:14:54
Oh, I I think we deleted.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:57
Let's see. I think it's still up there.

Lem   1:14:58
The.

Bryan Wolf   1:14:59
I didn't delete it the last one.

Lem   1:15:01
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:05
Yeah. OK.
OK, OK.
OK so.

Lem   1:15:10
Yeah, I think we would need the client ID and client key.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:18
I know we've done this a million times. Then I'm so sorry.

Lem   1:15:20
Yeah, it's it's OK.
Yeah, Google is really very yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:15:25
It's so temperamental. It's very ****.
See, I got this too.

Lem   1:16:04
Same because this app sent invalid regiment.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:04
That's 'cause, I've just got too much.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to delete out of that.
I'm sorry.
You know, I try this.

Lem   1:16:09
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:12
Let's.

Lem   1:16:15
Oh, that's odd.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:36
So what is this cause?
Usually execution resolver.

Lem   1:16:39
We can leave Team account because it's use in one incomplete execution, so we delete.
Oh.
Think. Yeah, I think this one.
Can you?
And then.

Bryan Wolf   1:16:54
Well, this is for LinkedIn posting as well. I just want to make sure it's it's not.

Lem   1:16:57
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:00
Oh God, yeah.
So it doesn't even OK.
So I'm just gonna make new one on on both.
Save changes.
Right. It was just these two. OK, so I guess.
Should I delete it to put a new one there just to refresh it or?

Lem   1:17:33
Uh.
I think you can like clone.
Because we have.
Yeah. Then try the other one. Yep.
You didn't change the scopes right on the console. Yeah, so yeah, basically.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:57
No, I don't. No, no, no.

Lem   1:18:03
Yeah, it should be the same on the.
On the data access, can you check the?
It should.
Yeah, it should be.
Yeah, it's actually good.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:15
This is.

Lem   1:18:16
Yeah, just the tool and then.
Yep, so.
MMM.
Oh, you missed. Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:31
There's two I know. I know there's 2IN front.

Lem   1:18:36
OK. And then?
Yeah. So.
This should be working.
It's odd.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:48
See, I think it's 'cause. I've tried to do it so many times.

Lem   1:18:53
You can say because this absent invalid request you can drag it or contact.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:57
I think it's 'cause I've tried.
It's I think it's 'cause. I've made too many client secrets.

Lem   1:18:59
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:01
I'm just gonna have to.

Lem   1:19:03
Yeah, but maybe.
But the Google Sheets are is the Google Sheets working or just the Google Drive right?

Bryan Wolf   1:19:12
Yeah, it's just it's just this one part.

Lem   1:19:13
I the the Google sheet.
I mean the Google sheet nodes modules.
So it's I know on the make on make.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:22
Like it works.
These work.
Yeah, these work fine.

Lem   1:19:26
Oh, OK.
So that's working.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:27
It's just these just these.

Lem   1:19:29
Yeah, the Google Drive.
Can you try it again or without the client ID and CI client key?
So maybe maybe it's.
Like it's has too much request or something.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:46
I think if that is request.

Lem   1:19:48
Like.
Customer information how to connect.

Bryan Wolf   1:19:51
So that CSS has scopes.

Lem   1:19:56
Oh, can we go back?
Yeah, maybe on the scopes.
On the library.
No, just no, no. OK there.
On the upper left side.
Yeah, the three and then.
Yeah, this one I the library API and service and you just search the Google Drive so maybe.
Maybe something?
Yeah, this one.
Yeah. So it's already enabled, huh? That's odd.

Bryan Wolf   1:20:30
I know that's what I'm saying.

Lem   1:20:31
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:20:31
I don't understand why.

Lem   1:20:43
Yeah.
Let me check my job 13 so.
Yeah, maybe we could also.
Can you try to enable also this one Google Drive activity API? So maybe.
Get info about activity on files and folders in Google Drive. OK.
So Yep.
Yeah, I think.
It's possible to use restricted scope.
Can you open here a Gmail?
Let's try again the Gmail one.
Yeah, Gmail.
And then yeah, just watch emails and then try create a connection.
Yeah. So the connection here also is.
Removed. So yeah, the on the check the this one. Yep.
Yeah, I'll try again.
Then.
OK, continue.
Then yeah, click this one. I want to allow me ongoing access.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:11
MMM.

Lem   1:22:12
I'm still, yeah.
Can you try to put the client ID and client key here on the Gmail?
So let's try it because I think last time, yeah, we we went through the Gmail route and then Google Drive.
On the Google Drive, we just like the basic authentication, so let's try it. If it would work.
Yep. And then the screen secret.
Yep. And then sign in.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:52
I'm telling you, I've done it too many times, I think.

Lem   1:22:53
Oh yeah, I think so.
So maybe, yeah, I think we need to like I think tomorrow or something can because this request access block.
Yep, this app's request is.
Yeah, I think like too many requests or something.
Huh.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:13
It's fine.
