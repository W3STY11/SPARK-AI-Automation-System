Lem Quimpo   0:34
Hello again.
Um, let me just.
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   0:43
I think he's.

Lem Quimpo   0:52
Uh.
Search Quiris.
Uh, 24 each.
OK, save.
Um, documentation.
Change the.

Nicholas Westburg   1:17
I know the words morning guys.

Lem Quimpo   1:17
Scrape system.

Bryan Wolf   1:19
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:21
Morning.
Script systems #5.
Number uh, this one.
#5 Twitter, LinkedIn or.
Yep, this one.
OK, 24 each.
OK, that's good.

Nicholas Westburg   2:03
Are we getting that first? Are we getting that? I don't think that I are.

Bryan Wolf   2:08
On a LinkedIn today.

Nicholas Westburg   2:11
That wasn't the newsletter that your dad wanted.

Bryan Wolf   2:13
Yeah, we we're he's about to meet us. We just me and Lem just ran one this morning. She looked like she thinks. I don't know if he'll want to put it out today, but we'll see what he thinks of it.
We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. There's gonna be some changes. Yeah, we're gonna have to change the the pictures on here, I think.

Lem Quimpo   2:32
The LinkedIn one, right?

Nicholas Westburg   2:38
Let me look at it. Where, uh, where'd you run it? Do I be going to make?

Bryan Wolf   2:42
I see.

Lem Quimpo   3:05
No.

Nicholas Westburg   3:12
What do you think of like a instead of a white?

Bryan Wolf   3:14
Hey, look at this though. I see this.

Lem Quimpo   3:17
Huh.

Nicholas Westburg   3:17
How about the URLs? Uh.

Lem Quimpo   3:20
Oh, it's odd.

Bryan Wolf   3:20
Well, this is this one. Some of these ones work.

Lem Quimpo   3:24
Still on Perplexity or on Inu Reader? Can we check that out? Treasury Management? Maybe that's on Perplexity. I think on the newsletter I have access also. Let me just check.

Bryan Wolf   3:27
I don't know.

Lem Quimpo   3:41
Perplexity filtered articles. Yeah, it's actually coming from perplexity. Maybe this is hallucinating again. Oh, right. It doesn't have the website URL. Yeah, so that's why.

Bryan Wolf   3:48
Yeah, I don't know.
****.
OK, that's OK. I guess we don't really want stuff like that, but yeah, it's fine.

Lem Quimpo   3:56
Um.
Yeah, yeah, I think we could just because the one that we picked doesn't have the website URL. So we could just like delete these ones or not choose it if there's no website URL on the on the spreadsheet. Yeah, on the filter article. So can.

Bryan Wolf   4:16
Was it in here?

Lem Quimpo   4:21
If you check it there, you can see it on. Yeah, it doesn't have the website. Yeah, that's right. So we could also add, I think on a guardrail on the perplexity one that if there's no URL.

Bryan Wolf   4:23
Uh, yeah. I wasn't even looking here. OK, OK.
Uh.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   4:41
Uh.
Insert most current relevant link based on confirmed site update.

Bryan Wolf   4:51
OK.

Lem Quimpo   4:52
Uh.
And.

Nicholas Westburg   5:20
Uh.

Lem Quimpo   5:27
For the let me just check also what this the.

Bryan Wolf   5:35
Looks good, Lem. I'm really happy with this actually.

Lem Quimpo   5:36
Uh.
Uh, yeah, I'll just check the.

Nicholas Westburg   5:40
That's OK.

Lem Quimpo   5:47
They update the.

Nicholas Westburg   5:52
Or like the blue legs.
Like I guess they're bolded. Are those backlinks for URLs like within the body paragraphs?

Lem Quimpo   6:01
No, just they're just like I've added to the prompt that it would highlight the like phrase something. Yeah, like like the most most. Yeah, like a most relevant phrase.

Bryan Wolf   6:01
No.

Nicholas Westburg   6:09
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   6:12
Like 4 treasurers, like where's the catch? Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   6:17
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   6:17
Yeah, but we could like remove it, remove it if.
Yeah, the the links has like a underline. Um. All the links has like underline. Um.

Nicholas Westburg   6:31
Back. Thanks.

Lem Quimpo   6:33
Yeah, the backlinks, I'm sorry.

Nicholas Westburg   6:36
Yeah, looks good, Lem Brian.

Lem Quimpo   6:39
Yep.
We just need, I think, to change the.

Nicholas Westburg   6:44
Just a few tweaks.

Lem Quimpo   6:45
Photos the Yeah, the.

Bryan Wolf   6:45
Pictures photos. I think I have one.

Lem Quimpo   6:49
The pictures. So what I did on the pictures is I've uploaded it on like a.

Bryan Wolf   6:56
Like, see, I got. I got this one right here. Like this is a this is one that he really likes. Peter really likes. This photo is better. He likes more.

Lem Quimpo   6:59
OK.

Nicholas Westburg   7:04
That that photo's sweet. That's clean.

Lem Quimpo   7:07
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   7:10
Do you want me to send this to you then?

Lem Quimpo   7:14
Yeah, OK, uh, you can send to me.

Nicholas Westburg   7:15
I think, I think this would stand out. This is just my personal opinion. It would pop with like a big header photo like that Serrala logo with like a like a darker, like a darker background with like another like bah, like a like a pink bah.

Bryan Wolf   7:30
Well, there's like, there's like photos that my dad has in mind because they have a new slogan. They have a new like mission statement that they want, that they have like under it. So I don't know, that's what he wants. It's like something.

Lem Quimpo   7:37
Oh, I see. Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   7:44
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   7:46
It it says it's this is the only happening right now. It's just it says finance engineer for the other. It says something else now and he wants to put that in there. So I don't know, but I'll send you this one and then maybe he can find a couple more than he can send to but.

Lem Quimpo   7:55
I see. Yep.

Nicholas Westburg   8:00
I think that I think that Serrala one would look really clean, the black with the pink.

Lem Quimpo   8:00
OK.

Bryan Wolf   8:04
Yeah, yeah, let me send this to you right now.
I don't know.

Lem Quimpo   8:22
For the black, yeah, what I actually did it is I uploaded it on like public no public image. Yeah like public image host. OK.

Bryan Wolf   8:28
I just sent you the picture, the one I just was looking at.

Lem Quimpo   8:37
Um, let me just check it.
Yeah, this looks good. I think I'll just need to edit it to be more longer and then.

Bryan Wolf   8:47
You said the format. Yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   8:50
Uh.

Nicholas Westburg   18:45
You know what's better? Can you send this as a draft my e-mail and I'll open it as if I've never seen it before and I'll totally strip through it.

Bryan Wolf   18:53
What?

Nicholas Westburg   18:54
The newsletter.

Bryan Wolf   18:56
Um, like what do you mean is a draft?

Nicholas Westburg   18:59
Just like, yeah, as it so is this going on LinkedIn or is this for the for the newsletter just gonna be sent?

Bryan Wolf   19:03
Oh, look.
This is the news that's gonna be shared to this company. This is nothing to do with LinkedIn. Like this is this is the only thing this I can send you.

Nicholas Westburg   19:08

Bryan Wolf   19:16
Oh, you wanna change? You wanna alter the stuff inside of it?

Lem Quimpo   19:17

I got a Bart in there too.

Nicholas Westburg   19:33
So then I'll just click through everything and.

No.
Why it doesn't work? It's odd.

Bryan Wolf   19:40
Yeah, I don't know. I admire his.

Nicholas Westburg   19:50
That's honestly the best feedback you can get is when you post a newsletter, you just have people open it and say, hey, you know, this is what I like, this is what you can do.

Bryan Wolf   19:56
Let's change this, Yeah, yeah. Which one is the Bravo one? I was.

Lem Quimpo   20:10

Bryan Wolf   20:52
Hey, Lem. So how do I, um, do the campaign again to add Bart and Nick? Umbrella, umbrella, umbrella.

Lem Quimpo   20:59
On the on Bravo create contact. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Are they already inside? Are they already in on the contacts or not yet?

Bryan Wolf   21:06
Create contact or yeah.
I don't think so. These are my contacts.
But how's it send it to me? How's it send it to me then?

Lem Quimpo   21:17
Oh, just two. Yeah. Uh, no, no.
Ha.
I think this are on your first, yeah, on the list, so we can go back to the contacts. Uh.
Let's go to contacts and then lists. Uh, your.

Bryan Wolf   21:35
Oh, this can't be the right account that I'm using then.

Lem Quimpo   21:36
Yeah, maybe. Or you can. Oh no, this is P9 Wolf name. So this this is correct. Just remove the. I think you should remove the.

Bryan Wolf   21:40
'Cause I'm I'm getting the e-mail.
I know, but look, look when I.
How do I How am I getting the e-mail then if I'm not on the list? Oh, this is Peter. I'm on Peter. Never mind. No, no, no, you're right, love. Excuse me. Excuse me. Yeah. So go to lists.

Lem Quimpo   21:58
Uh.
Yeah, it's uh.

Bryan Wolf   22:05
Green list.

Lem Quimpo   22:06
No, we need to add the contact first. So contacts, yeah, create a contact and then you could add him on the list here. So list it's already there the your first list. So you could just add the yeah, first name and last name and then the e-mail.

Bryan Wolf   22:23
They give me an e-mail.

Nicholas Westburg   22:26

dot PNG OK.

Bryan Wolf   23:53

Lem Quimpo   23:59

Bryan Wolf   23:59
You know that I added these contacts.

Lem Quimpo   24:02
Yeah, can you go back to the lists?

Bryan Wolf   24:04
Wait, should I import contacts now?

Lem Quimpo   24:07
Did you? No, you can refresh. Yeah, I think it's just. Yeah. So it's there already. Yep. Then you could. Yeah, you could send a campaign. Yeah, we could. You could actually. Yeah. On the spreadsheet, we could trigger it.

Bryan Wolf   24:12
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   24:18
OK.

Lem Quimpo   24:24
From there.
So on the spreadsheet.

Bryan Wolf   24:28
They all know.

Lem Quimpo   24:32
Uh oh, you double check on Bravo, right? Uh, you chose the your first list.

Bryan Wolf   24:35
Yeah.
Should I turn these on now or no? I can just do it from here, right?

Lem Quimpo   24:41
Yep, you yeah, you could. You could.
Yeah, on the newsletter drafts and then click uh yes on the send final newsletter.

Bryan Wolf   24:51
Oh, I'm just gonna do the test again. I'm just gonna do it.

Lem Quimpo   24:52
I know it's.
OK, yeah, yeah, you could do the test again. Yep, that's right. No. Yeah, no, not, not really. So.

Bryan Wolf   24:57
What's the difference? There isn't a difference here.
Hmm.

Lem Quimpo   25:05
But yeah, that would like, I think, create a new document. Yeah, that would create.

Bryan Wolf   25:06
Oh ****. **** me. Just unmute this brand.
Right.

Lem Quimpo   25:16
Yeah, but I think, yeah, it it it will still take time, so you could, yeah, but yeah, maybe it would error out and just wait for it to finish I think.

Bryan Wolf   25:18
I'm just not that ****.
Yeah.
I'm gonna look at it in a second. Let me just.
Dunction.

Lem Quimpo   25:38
Yes.

Bryan Wolf   26:08
Photos and done.

Lem Quimpo   26:11
Yeah, I think it's the. Let me just.

Bryan Wolf   26:40
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   26:49

Bryan Wolf   27:07
Yeah, look.

Lem Quimpo   27:09
Oh.
On the.

Bryan Wolf   27:11
Look.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   27:14

No.

Bryan Wolf   27:20
Nick, you should get an e-mail now. No, no, I I know what you're saying.
OK, now what?

Lem Quimpo   27:29
I no click edit design first. So I'll I'll just yeah and then copy this link I put on the chat. Yeah there's a link so that we could also try it out.
So copy this link and then put it on the. As you can see there's like a holiday on the.
Can you see the uh, OK, OK, OK uh.

Bryan Wolf   28:01
I'm going to stop.

Lem Quimpo   28:07
Stop. Yeah, that there image source.https:imgore.png. Yeah, paste it there. Yeah, yeah, that's right. OK And then click preview and test.
So I think, yeah, that that's right. Yeah. So that that's the like the new banner as you can see on the.
Then save and quit. Yep.

Bryan Wolf   28:31
Talking good, landmark. Should I send it out again?

Lem Quimpo   28:33
Yeah, sure. Uh, for this one though, you could just send it already to the list.
So you can add the recipients.
I don't. We could trigger it on the spreadsheet on the automation, so.

Bryan Wolf   28:48
So I can so I can say I want them to see it like that.

Lem Quimpo   28:52
No, uh, here on the other one.

Bryan Wolf   28:55
On what on this?

Lem Quimpo   28:56
On the send final, on the other column. So yeah, that's one. That one is. Yeah, yeah, you can do that one now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. It's OK. Yeah. So that should trigger the send campaign.

Bryan Wolf   29:00
Who cares? Yeah, whatever. Can I do that now? Even though I just deleted it? Can I do it? Even though I deleted this, I can still do it.

Lem Quimpo   29:13
And then let's check the number four. Yeah, the number four. Yep, that one. That should trigger it. So, oh, it's still not turned on yet, so we need to turn this one.

Bryan Wolf   29:17
Which one is that one?

Lem Quimpo   29:29
Oh, right, the API key. Yeah, so we need to change. Oh, we we already changed this API key, right? Or.

Bryan Wolf   29:36
Yeah, I don't know why I just did that. You just sent out. I just sent out another copy a couple minutes ago. See.

Lem Quimpo   29:44
And I no, I think this is just a test because there's like test there test newsletter. So it it yeah it this errored out because of the I think the API key. So let's we can go back to the diagram and.
Um, Yep. Yeah, it.

Bryan Wolf   30:00
I sent you an e-mail yesterday with the no one ****.

Lem Quimpo   30:04
Yeah, this one.

Bryan Wolf   30:06
Oh, I just say.

Lem Quimpo   30:08
Yeah, the API key for P9. This is P9 OK.

Bryan Wolf   30:12
For Brevo, for Brevo, right?

Lem Quimpo   30:14
Yeah, forever, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   30:19
That's the same one, man. I'm telling you, I just did OK, but.

Lem Quimpo   30:25
Oh, it's the same one. So maybe it just. Oh, right. It's from July 25. So you could turn this on and then.
And then process all data up. OK, yeah, so that should.
Uh, basically, can you check it again the make scenario if?
Uh, it triggered out.
Can you?
Can you hit refresh or it's just lagging? Not sure if.
Why didn't it run?
It didn't process the date.
Oh, this. Yeah, that's. Yeah, but it's a queue. But excuse me, it's not triggering. That's odd.

Bryan Wolf   31:20
This is it.
It's In the queue.

Lem Quimpo   31:32
Yeah, it's yeah, you could run it once, then just use existing data, OK.

Bryan Wolf   31:32
And once.

Lem Quimpo   31:41
Wolf.
Can't we schedule? Please provide valid list ID. Can you?
Can you go go back there on the let me just check why is that on the make.com?
So can you go on the HTTP HTTP request?
Inside the Can you click the yeah node and then just.
Oh, I think it's because.
The can can you go back to the Bravo campaign on Nope on make.com the one that is test e-mail the number 3.
So the yeah, the content formatter because we need to actually assign the list here on no on the other one.
Yeah, and here. Yeah, that's right. So you need to choose the.
Uh, Yep, there. Uh, at the top. Yeah, this one. Uh, no.
Recipients. Yeah, the recipients should be below list. Yeah, yeah, trigger that one. Yeah, your list. And then can you go, can you go down?
Why did? Uh, yeah, go down.
Yes, I think that's it. Can you go up again on the?
Yes, I think that's the only.
Just double check also.
But yeah, we could try to run it once again. Let's try to run it once. Yeah, just run it once. Use existing data. Let's test if it.
Cannot reschedule provided by this ID that's odd. Can you go back to Bravo Bravo and then just check is this because we already can can you click this?
The the first one, the number 16.
If it has, yeah, this one.
Yeah, it doesn't have a recipient, so that's that's why. So we we need actually we need to. We haven't chosen the list yet a while ago, right? So it doesn't have a recipient. That's why it can't send the data. But yeah, basically I click save first.
And then, yeah, so uh, let's go back to the uh, let me just check on.
Uh.
Yep. OK, so now.

Bryan Wolf   34:44
Give me one second. I'm sorry.

Lem Quimpo   34:47

This, this one, just just the one. Just 'cause I know he wanted to change the other ones, but we we Can obviously that's like very small stuff we Can change. But this is the new one part. Let me just let let's finish this up so he Can just look at it on his computer.

Bartosz Borek   36:44
Oh, just like a basic. All right. Yeah, that's that's better.

Bryan Wolf   36:59
Um, so we added the campaign again, yeah.

For the.

Bryan Wolf   37:52
Alright, see if you got that e-mail.
If I have that, you know actually.

Lem Quimpo   38:01
Also we need we need to update if that photo like the Serrala block photo. So we need to update it on the content formatter. You can just copy paste it on the.

Bryan Wolf   38:06
Yeah, yeah, we have to do.

Lem Quimpo   38:16
Is it? Yeah, on the G uh ChatGPT. So it's on, uh, the same.
On the first part of the HTML code, so you can see it as image source. So yeah, go down more a little bit, a little bit. Yeah, that one, the imgur. Yeah, the IMG URL. Yeah, so just.

Oh, that's the API. Yeah, it's API key. So the one should be.

Bryan Wolf   39:12
This what you sent me? That's the API key.
I said so did this send In the e-mail yet?

Lem Quimpo   39:24
Yeah, it should be on the on the Microsoft no.

Bryan Wolf   39:28

Sorry, let me just.

Bartosz Borek   39:37
Still don't still don't have anything so.

Nicholas Westburg   39:42
OK, I got it.

Bryan Wolf   39:43
I put it In In this e-mail here, alright.

Nicholas Westburg   39:49
It looks good. First thing opening or seeing it In the inbox. Sorella Sorella Newsletter, July 25, 2025.

Bartosz Borek   39:50
Um.

Bryan Wolf   40:03
I'm sorry, let me just go to your thing.

Lem Quimpo   40:22
Oh yeah, there on the yeah, that's on HTTP up to the PNG. Oops.
Yep, that's right.
And then, yeah, let's, I think it could, yeah, they just double check it maybe.

Nicholas Westburg   40:41
So I think this looks really good just from first sight. Can you guys hear me?

Lem Quimpo   40:42
Uh.
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   40:47
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   40:47
Yep.

Bartosz Borek   40:48
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   40:49
The image looks a little small. The Serrala header. It's almost the same size as like the first paragraph or like the introduction.

Lem Quimpo   40:54
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   40:58
I think we're gonna make some changes on the pictures. I just wanted to put a different one in there because I know Peter wanted like he's didn't. Do you guys have like they have a new slogan or something else to put in there too? Where?

Nicholas Westburg   41:05
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   41:12
Yeah. Can you go down a bit on the let's check the I yeah, I think that's the one enemy. Yeah, this, this get just click save. OK then click save again on the.

Bryan Wolf   41:18
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   41:26
Yeah, so maybe this that's just temporary image the like the black Sorella one or not sure.

Bryan Wolf   41:31
Alright, do you see it out there?

Bartosz Borek   41:34
I still don't have it. I just sent myself a test e-mail and I got it. I wonder if it's in like some junk folder or something.

Bryan Wolf   41:40
Yeah, check all mail. Sometimes it shows up in all mail.

Lem Quimpo   41:42
Yeah, maybe it's on the promotions because sometimes if yeah, it's being sent, if it's for your first, maybe if it's sent first, yeah, you received it like initially it's it goes to the promotion, I think promotions or like.

Bryan Wolf   41:44
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   42:04
Or we could also check the logs on Bravo if it already you could. You could also check if it already delivered to all of the Yep.

Bryan Wolf   42:17
Yeah, sorry, I'm gonna look at that.

Lem Quimpo   42:19
And.
On the transactional, Yep, then also.
Yeah, so open, open from to. Uh, yeah, it didn't. It still didn't updated it yet. Yeah, that's that's.

Bryan Wolf   42:37
Let me know.

Lem Quimpo   42:43
Yeah, this there's some delays there on their logs, but can you click the real time the one on?
Of uh above the logs, so statistics and then real time if that would.
Change anything natural also.

Bryan Wolf   43:03
Sorry, yeah, statistics. You wanna check e-mail?

Bartosz Borek   43:09
I still don't got it. Still don't have it anyway.

Lem Quimpo   43:09
Yeah, it didn't. Yeah, still still didn't updated the history. That's odd.

Bartosz Borek   43:16
Oh, so that's so that's why I didn't get it or?

Bryan Wolf   43:20
I don't know.
Nick, you got it, you said, right?
No, it's still not updating.

Nicholas Westburg   43:26
Yeah, I received it at 9:37 PSD.

Bryan Wolf   43:31
Do you have another e-mail maybe? Or is that like the e-mail you use the most?

Bartosz Borek   43:36
That's the e-mail I always use. I just sent myself an e-mail from my Gmail and it was uh.

Bryan Wolf   43:39
Oh.

Lem Quimpo   43:41
Uh.

Nicholas Westburg   43:43
Did it get triggered to spam maybe, Bart?

Bartosz Borek   43:43
It delivered.
I already checked. Yeah, there's nothing in spam, nothing in junk.

Lem Quimpo   43:50
Oh, that's all.

Bryan Wolf   43:51
Maybe it's 'cause it's based.
Because you know what? I don't know if Peter. Yeah, but he gets it all. I'm checking on this. I'm checking on this. That's what. So I don't know. I don't know. Actually, I think now that I remember, I think we did have. I think we did have that problem now that I think about it.

Bartosz Borek   43:58
Yeah, but Peter gets it every day, right? Or does it go to his Gmail? Oh ****.
Yeah, I wonder if our Serrala blocks it.

Bryan Wolf   44:15
And then it's just for forwarding content. I can't remember. He's on a call right now, so I don't wanna.

Lem Quimpo   44:21
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   44:25
Excuse me for eating too.

Lem Quimpo   44:28
But in the yesterday he was able to read it on Outlook, right? But is it the P9 or the Serrala one?

Bryan Wolf   44:37
I think it was just P9, just P9 on surround. So I bet you surrounds blogging it.

Lem Quimpo   44:39
Oh, it's oh.
Um.
Oh, that's a problem.
Mom.
Yeah, maybe it's blocking it or.
So it's not going to spam also, so that's.
Huh.

Bartosz Borek   45:05
I think the Serrala server might just be blocking it. Yeah, totally.

Lem Quimpo   45:06
Um.

Bryan Wolf   45:06
Lock in it.
What?

Bartosz Borek   45:12
That's *******. That's bogus.

Bryan Wolf   45:14
Because even when you forwarded it, it totally changes the entire format and the entire entire e-mail.

Nicholas Westburg   45:23
So frustrating. So with Akish, where the company that I'm working for, I was doing some marketing stuff, but I had some like really good content that I wanted to get out. Like I was doing some of the LinkedIn stuff for them and they just like cut me from it because they said that my my marketing.
My marketing content didn't fit the guideline or the agenda for.
Whatever. And they just they wouldn't. They wouldn't let it go through.

Bryan Wolf   45:48
Sure, our project around.

Lem Quimpo   45:54
4.
Cool.

Bryan Wolf   46:17
Let me see if I can.

Lem Quimpo   46:18
Uh.
Yeah, the I think how would this if we have like a pro plan on Bravo, we could actually change the e-mail there to the like the regional e-mail.

Bryan Wolf   46:39
We're gonna definitely just end up, uh, upgrading the plan. If I can do that now, I'll just leave it.

Lem Quimpo   46:40
Because.
Yeah, yeah, because we're still sending it on. As you can see, Nick, right, the e-mail is coming from like at brevosend.com. Yeah, that one the as you can see p9@brevosend.com.

Nicholas Westburg   46:57
Oh, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   46:57
So yeah, that is actually from like the Bravo, like hosted e-mail, something like that. Yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   47:01
That's definitely why it's getting blocked.

Nicholas Westburg   47:03
So they're making you, they're making you pay for the other plan. What?

Lem Quimpo   47:07
Yeah, if if we pay the premium plan, so we we could change that one to like@gmail.com like the original e-mail. So even like the starter, the $9 per month. So we could change that one to like our original e-mail. So it's coming from our e-mail, not the bravosend.com.

Bryan Wolf   47:23
Marketing automation.
It's reporting in Alex Tools.
That should.

Lem Quimpo   47:53
Mm.

Bryan Wolf   48:05
Monthly number of emails 5000.
Business.

Lem Quimpo   48:14
Yeah, that's, uh, that is also one of the.
Um.
Like the one that we will look at like the pricing of emails like because if you would send 1000 emails per week and then IAB we could just send one news one campaign per week for that because their $9 plan has only 5000 per month.
So we could just, uh, yes, send.

Bryan Wolf   48:47
Thanks for $18,000 plan only is 5000 too.

Lem Quimpo   48:47
1.
Yeah, the other ones, right? Yeah, the other plans.

Bryan Wolf   48:53
Oh, I think you can. Uh, you can. You can customize.

Lem Quimpo   48:57
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   48:57
How many contacts you want and I'll base the price of the plan off at.
Go ahead.

Lem Quimpo   49:08
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   49:31
He should be getting on now.
He's gonna hop on in a second.

Lem Quimpo   50:36
Mhm.

Bryan Wolf   50:55
You're on mute.

Peter Wolf   51:00
Hold on a second.

Lem Quimpo   51:00
Create a prompt I already changed this to.
List.

Peter Wolf   51:12
Can you hear me? Ohh It's not going to my headphones, hold on a second.

Bryan Wolf   51:13
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   51:14
Yep.
SIM card.

Peter Wolf   51:34
Hey, you guys hear me now?

Bryan Wolf   51:36
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   51:43
Can you hear me now? OK, good. Now I I hear it. Yep.

Lem Quimpo   51:44
OK, Yep.

Bartosz Borek   51:45
Yeah, we can hear you, Peter. Peter, apparently there's a problem because I'm not getting the newsletter even though I was added to the list. So I think Serrala is blocking it like our servers.

Bryan Wolf   51:45
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   51:56
I get it in mine. Oh, no, no, you're right. I get it. I get it in my ****. Seriously. Are you telling me this is going to be blocked? Oh my God.

Bryan Wolf   51:57
And not in your check. Check your outlook.

Bartosz Borek   51:58
I thought you'd get it in your gene now.

Bryan Wolf   52:03
Gmail.

Lem Quimpo   52:04
Gmail.

Bartosz Borek   52:05
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   52:11
Don't tell me that.

Bryan Wolf   52:13
Well, so here's what Lem said. Lem said when you upgrade your plan, so like when you click on your e-mail here to.

Lem Quimpo   52:13
Oh.

Bartosz Borek   52:13
Sorry.

Lem Quimpo   52:27
Thank you.

Bryan Wolf   52:28
Tom.

Peter Wolf   52:29
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   52:30
If you upgrade your plan, um.

Peter Wolf   52:32
I get to put a different. I get to put a different e-mail address.

Bryan Wolf   52:35
Yeah, I think so. That's what I said, but I don't know if it will still take Gmail emails or Can you use a serral to input an e-mail or will that not work?

Lem Quimpo   52:36
Yeah, that's right. Like, yeah, the Gmail.
If you no, if you use Seralla, we would need to like update and connect to your website.

Nicholas Westburg   52:46
OK.

Bryan Wolf   52:48
Right, right, right, right, right, right, right.

Nicholas Westburg   52:49
I'm just confused because with my company e-mail like.

Peter Wolf   52:52
OK, hold on, hold on, hold on. Slow down, guys. Too many people talking. So, so let me if we're we're doing it Gmail.

Bryan Wolf   53:00
Not now, Pete.

Bartosz Borek   53:00
Hey, Peter, I I I can't hear you very well. You seem like you're talking through like a yeah.

Lem Quimpo   53:02
Hello.
It's chopping. Uh, yeah.

Peter Wolf   53:07
Yeah, hold on.
All right, Can you hear me now?

Bryan Wolf   53:18
The same, but yeah.

Lem Quimpo   53:19
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   53:20
It's the same.

Bryan Wolf   53:21
Well, it just sounds like you're muffled. If you're breaking up before, but if you split slowly, I Can understand you.

Bartosz Borek   53:23
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   53:28
And we'll try to speak slowly, Brian. No. So, yeah, so I'm not sure why I'm having trouble with the audience. So what I was saying, so you you said, Lem, if you Can answer that if.

Bryan Wolf   53:31
OK. All right. No, thanks.
It's like it sounds good. It's just a little multiple, but it's great.

Lem Quimpo   53:45
OK.

Peter Wolf   53:47
We would have to go to enterprise version or something or what? Or business version or what?

Lem Quimpo   53:52
No, I think just the starter and then.
Yeah, just on starter. So let me just check also here on because we could change the e-mail depending on our plan also. So we could change the e-mail that is coming from our particular e-mail, not the like the bravosend.com.
So uh, let me but.

Peter Wolf   54:20
So are you saying that I could use, I could use the corporate e-mail or no, that would that would not work?

Lem Quimpo   54:25
Uh.
You could use the corporate e-mail, but we would need to have access on like your website because we're gonna there's like an authentication that's if that e-mail is really part of the company, if that makes sense. So we need to like an essay.

Peter Wolf   54:43
OK, but I mean I the e-mail is part of the company, So what we they send the confirmation to my e-mail account or something?

Lem Quimpo   54:50
To the website like the website connection. So depending on the website, so we could just yeah basically we need like an access to the website so like like.
Like the logins for that website and then we could uh, there would be like an opt in, like an authentication that would connect your e-mail to that particular website like the Serrala website.
So they they are.

Peter Wolf   55:18
Alright, so I I would need, I would need some some documentation that tells me exactly what I need to request. So I would have to get the IT Team or the marketing Team or somebody to to do that.

Lem Quimpo   55:32
OK. Yeah. OK. Yeah, I'll, I'll, yeah, I'll sort that out. Yeah. Basically you what we can do is you could give your IT guys your Bravo like Bravo account 1st and then let them I think, yeah, they would know how to like.
But yeah, I will also give a documentation.

Peter Wolf   55:51
I would not trust that my my IT Team knows anything. They've proven themselves unaware of most things, and the marketing Team doesn't know a damn thing either, so.

Lem Quimpo   55:54
Uh.

Bartosz Borek   55:57
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   55:58
Uh.
Yeah, I I'll, I'll provide also documentation and then, uh, yeah, so.

Bryan Wolf   56:01
Nice.

Lem Quimpo   56:07
What we can do is, yeah, they can open the account and then they would be the ones who would like authenticate the the like the e-mail to Sarala. So there.

Peter Wolf   56:15
So we would create, we'd have to create a new account and that new account then would would be create. The Bravo account would be created and and assigned to the to the Sarala environment or something.

Lem Quimpo   56:29
Yeah, the at serala.com for example you would use the Peter Wolf at serala.com. So that at serala.com would need be need you would need to be verified if that is really like has like permission because I think yeah they they're doing that way that way because maybe for example you have like a.

Peter Wolf   56:34
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   56:48
Funny website, right? And then you don't have permission to like use the company's name to like like spam. Yeah, like spam.

Peter Wolf   56:53
Yeah, I got you. I got you. I understand. I understand the rationale. I just need to know exactly what it requires and hopefully I'll be able to to get that. I like that top banner. That's that's freaking great. But that's not our, that's not the way we do it anymore. I think now they don't want US, using that color or something.

Lem Quimpo   56:58
Yeah.
Yep. Uh.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   57:08
Yes.
I know, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   57:11
Uh.

Peter Wolf   57:12
You know, after telling us, yelling at US, forever, I I I don't. I don't know. We'll see. We'll see.

Bartosz Borek   57:13
Really?
Oh, it's it's gotta be pro. Maybe we could change it to white and then it would just be safe, right?

Peter Wolf   57:20
Yeah.
Yeah, I think that's now it's not supposed to be red or something, but we'll and I think white would actually look sharper. But But that's that's good. It looks I like that, though, right? I like that. We're also not supposed to do that. That finance engineered now for success. It's like it's like move. It's like proceed.

Bartosz Borek   57:29
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   57:43
with clarity or something like that. So it's all stupid ****. But yeah, so before we didn't even have that up top, right? So that's great. I'm I'm very pleased with that that addition. And Can you scroll down gradually?

Bryan Wolf   58:05
You got your own. You Can just open up your own e-mail. This is your e-mail, yeah.

Peter Wolf   58:05
Yeah.
Oh, right. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, yeah, I got you.
So I.

Lem Quimpo   58:21
Yes.

Peter Wolf   58:56
I'm still updating. Hold on, I don't have it yet. It's trying to pull them into Outlook.
All right, well, I'm I'm still waiting for it to come through for whatever reason. It's it's, yeah, no, not my serality.

Bryan Wolf   59:25
Your e-mail, Seralla, it's I'm looking at it, you know, In your Google e-mail. I'm looking at it right now. It's In your P9, book nine. There's one that says Seralla and then there's the one that says test newsletter.

Peter Wolf   59:42
Um.
So I understand that I'm In my main, I'm In my main inbox. So the OK, the problem is that yeah, I see it now. I have a rule that's supposed to move that to another folder and I didn't see it In the other folder, so I didn't think it was there yet. OK, I'm not sure why it didn't work In that folder, but.

Bryan Wolf   59:45
P9 Wolf 9 at Gmail.

Peter Wolf   1:00:04
Or why the rule didn't apply?
OK, so interesting. I'm confused. Where was that Sarala logo you just had? Where did you? Where did that?

Bryan Wolf   1:00:13
So we did that. So listen, we we did that in.
Um, so we originally said this one first, right? Me and them were just testing this out first, right? And then if you go to Bravo.
And you go to where was it then? Uh.

Lem Quimpo   1:00:37
The campaigns.
Oh, is that like the one we edited or?

Bryan Wolf   1:00:40
Template or no?

Bartosz Borek   1:00:42
Correct.
Hey guys, I have a RTX call. I got dropped.

Peter Wolf   1:00:48
OK. OK. Hey, hey, I'm sorry. What? What is that called? What is that called, Bart?

Bryan Wolf   1:00:48
OK, um, so we we clicked on this.

Bartosz Borek   1:00:52

Peter Wolf   1:00:56
OK. OK, good. All right. Thanks. Appreciate it. Talk to you.

Bartosz Borek   1:01:01
Yeah, like.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:02
But when you go to here you Can edit design, right? So this is the first one we sent out. So instead of sending a whole new thing we and having to change it, which we did do afterwards, you Can just go into Bravo and do edit design and then you I have a a on this.

Lem Quimpo   1:01:03
You are.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:01:13
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:21
In the chat that Lam sent, he sent a he sent a URL to the image and then you you go down to here and you change it right here so then it changes the the so then you Can preview and test and it'll change the first one. So like let's just do it for your reason.

Peter Wolf   1:01:24
OK, so you just put some new code In with a different. Yeah, OK, great.
Awesome. OK.
Great. Well, I like that. I like that new one that look again, I don't, I don't know if that's gonna be allowed, but that's that's definitely good.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:40
I know you like that image. I know what.
You don't have this e-mail. This is this is see the.

Peter Wolf   1:01:49
I I don't have that. I don't see it. Maybe I'm because this e-mail is from 9:25 AM which is just.

Bryan Wolf   1:01:56
Yeah, there's one at 937.

Peter Wolf   1:01:58
Uh, hold on.
OK, I see it now.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:08
It's the same thing, it just has a different picture. And then we chose one of the this one right here that we chose. I screwed up 'cause I on the thing where it's like STS.

Peter Wolf   1:02:10
Yeah, no, that's good. I like it.

Lem Quimpo   1:02:23
The filtered articles. Yeah, it doesn't have a link.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:23
Or filtered so I I picked one that doesn't have a URL but by mistake so usually it would that would work. But this doesn't have a URL because I picked I was testing it and I picked the wrong one but the rest of them would work.

Peter Wolf   1:02:36
Question. You see where we're doing AI Finance News and it does that for each one. We really should only have one time AI Finance News and then it should have the three articles, not the same header over and over again. What do you think of that?

Bryan Wolf   1:02:48
OK, I agree.

Peter Wolf   1:02:51
Right, so I would just do a line like there's a line. Yeah, see how there's a line above the image? We could still do the line between them, but don't redo the header each time.

Bryan Wolf   1:02:53
Like Sia says this.

Lem Quimpo   1:02:55
OK.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:03:01
Yeah, get rid of this there.

Lem Quimpo   1:03:03
OK, like, OK, like they they're all, they're, yeah, they're all in one section. Is that is that right?

Bryan Wolf   1:03:05
To just combine it into one section instead of three different sections.

Peter Wolf   1:03:10
Yeah, that would be fine, right? That's that's what we're saying is 1 header, just like social signals, just like the others. It's one header and then three articles separated by a line or something, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:03:11
No. So he wants them to be, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:03:13
Uh, OK.
Yes.
OK. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:03:26
Because if you scroll up, each one of those is their own box with their own header, and that's just wasted space of repeat, right? So I would just do a line between the one article and the next image, then that article and the next image, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:03:31
Yeah, uh, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:03:42
In one box, 1 box, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:03:45
Yeah, in one box. That's right. It just has like a line, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:03:46
So that's what we'll we'll make that tweak. OK, so then.

Lem Quimpo   1:03:52
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:03:56
I should say no.

Lem Quimpo   1:03:58
In one section.

Peter Wolf   1:04:29
The one thing I noticed if you go down to the Sarala Daily Insights, I like it. I see the the authors right, but weird that In for example in.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:37
Mm.
It's all from perplexity. That's why I see it, 'cause I think you that one of those articles might have been from before you got the new title, 'cause this is all from the Internet.

Peter Wolf   1:04:50
But it's not that. But look at how In mind, the thing that it decided they wanted to highlight is my title. OK. Hey, Nick, I'm sorry we haven't connected. Nick, we got to get together at the beginning of next week. I apologize. I want to go through the stuff that you're pulling together and talk about those.

Nicholas Westburg   1:04:54
Hey guys, I need to drop and get on another meeting.

Lem Quimpo   1:04:56
Uh, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:04:58
OK, see you next.

Peter Wolf   1:05:07
Talk about the the, you know, the repository. Talk about the tools we talked about and stuff that you're building. So Can we. We'll definitely do that on Monday, OK.

Nicholas Westburg   1:05:17
Absolutely. Don't stress it either. I know you're swamped too, so yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:05:20
All right, thanks. And just a little sideline. You know, your dad called me this. What's up, right? But he was really cool about it. He was like, oh, do you? Yeah, do you do you really think this is Can Can turn into something? I'm like, yeah, ****, Nick is far along. This is going to turn into something for Nick. And I said, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:05:24
Hey, he did. He did.

Lem Quimpo   1:05:27
So.

Nicholas Westburg   1:05:28
Saying what?

Bryan Wolf   1:05:29
He was like, what is? What the **** is this about? What's Nick doing?

Peter Wolf   1:05:40
I think your dad just doesn't get it, right? He just doesn't get it? Yeah, so it's kind of baffling to him, but I gave him a strong response and said this is definitely, you know, you're you're often deep In and a lot of other stuff. I said the stuff we're doing is pretty basic, but I think it is adding value and I think looking at

Bryan Wolf   1:05:43
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:05:43
He doesn't understand it at all In the slightest of this.

Peter Wolf   1:06:00
process flows, also stimulating ideas for you and whatnot. So, all right, what now?

Nicholas Westburg   1:06:04
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:05
Yeah.

Nicholas Westburg   1:06:06
Huh.

Peter Wolf   1:06:08
All right. Goodbye. See you next.

Nicholas Westburg   1:06:09
Alright, take it out. Yeah, we'll link next week.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:11
Can I? Yeah. See you, bro. Bye.

Peter Wolf   1:06:12
Yeah, great. OK, so So what I'm talking about is looking out how In each section is taking something to highlight, but In my it's it highlighted my In mine, it highlighted my name instead of of something In the body.

Nicholas Westburg   1:06:13
See you guys. Bye.

Lem Quimpo   1:06:15
See you next.
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, I think I need.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:27
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:06:27
That looks a little weird. We should we should give some kind of comment that says don't don't ever highlight the person's name because that looks weird. Like somehow I'm trying to say, oh, the most important thing is it's by me, right? I don't want that.

Lem Quimpo   1:06:34
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:38
Me. It's Peter.

Lem Quimpo   1:06:39
Yeah, yeah, I think I need to add a guardrail for that because yeah, Chat GPD is just I added that on the chat.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:44
No.

Peter Wolf   1:06:47
Yeah, I got it. I understand why. I'm just saying let's put a guardrail. Like you said, let's put a guardrail In there to make sure that the highlight is not going to be that.

Lem Quimpo   1:06:50
Yeah, Gardley.

Bryan Wolf   1:06:53
I like how it's pulling in like blog posts that got, you know, Giles is posted. I like that. That's so cool, Jill.

Lem Quimpo   1:06:55
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:07:00
Yeah, well, that's the idea. I want to give everybody on the Team an opportunity to get visibility, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:07:07
Mhm.

Lem Quimpo   1:07:08
Yeah, yeah, Perplexity is also, uh, really good on getting the the author and.

Bryan Wolf   1:07:11
It's cool.
Yeah, that's that. That's automated. That's perplexity. Just looking that up and finding it. And then it's so cool. Lem, you did a great job.

Lem Quimpo   1:07:17
Yeah, Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:07:17
I know, I know.
Hey, one thing I would like to do, I wonder if there's a way if we could put into perplexity that it would know that it's a video, right? Because In the video it's a landing page and if it were a blog, it wouldn't talk about it, wouldn't, it wouldn't necessarily have a video or maybe it could have a video link or something.

Lem Quimpo   1:07:22
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:07:38
But I wonder if we could tweak the the prompt to tell it to determine if if if the if the link is a video or a link has a video encoded and then it could then it could maybe put In parentheses after the title it could say video.
Right. Or video link or something like that to differentiate it. So someone would say, oh, OK, there's actually a, you know, or webinar or something that it would put there. I think that would be attractive. Can you see if you Can come up with some kind of wording that would maybe let it look at that?

Lem Quimpo   1:07:58
Oh, OK.
Yeah.
Mm.
Yeah, I'll.
Yeah, I'll try. I I I just also need a like a sample link. Do you have like a webinar here?

Peter Wolf   1:08:18
Yeah, sure. Here, I'll give you. I'll give you a couple right now. I'll pull them up and then I'll populate them into the chat. Hold on a second.

Lem Quimpo   1:08:22
Yeah.
OK, yeah, yeah, right. For example, this one like the watch now webinar. Yeah, on Vimeo. But Vimeo video, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:08:31
Yeah, the the one that the one that you have for Gilles is actually a video, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:08:37
Mm.

Peter Wolf   1:08:39
So hold on, I guess access this is uh.

Lem Quimpo   1:08:40
This.
Uh, on Jill. Uh, no, it's not a video, but this other one, the estate.

Peter Wolf   1:08:50
Oh, I mean that might have been a blog because he did both. He did blogs and and videos, but.

Lem Quimpo   1:08:54
Yeah, the Estee Loader's in house something Estee Loader company.

Peter Wolf   1:08:57
Yeah, that's that's a that's a video. Again, some are blogs, some are videos. So let me, uh, hold on a second. Let me surround the.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:01
Yeah, webinar. This is a web. Yeah, I think.

Peter Wolf   1:09:08
Here, let me share my screen for a minute.
Then I'll put the links In but.
Um.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:27
I want checker.
Try to check link if video or webinar.

Peter Wolf   1:09:38
The.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:41
Superplexity and then like the end goal is to like have.

Peter Wolf   1:09:49
It just put In parentheses after the title that it's a video or a webinar instead of instead of a blog, right? Maybe maybe we should do that for each one and it's like after it should either say blog or it should say video or something like that.

Lem Quimpo   1:09:52
That's a video, right? Oh, OK, yeah. Like a video or webinar. Yep. Yeah, I yeah.
Yeah, blog or video. Yeah, I think, uh.

Peter Wolf   1:10:04
So that way it would always put something. So if I go to sural.com.

Lem Quimpo   1:10:08
Yep, yeah.
Yeah, I think a perplexity would be able to, yeah, uh, check that one.

Peter Wolf   1:10:18
Hold on Resources Knowledge Center.

Lem Quimpo   1:10:22
If if blog or.

Peter Wolf   1:10:28
I agree.

Lem Quimpo   1:10:30
Oh.
This name is this blog post section.
OK, um.

Peter Wolf   1:11:01
There you go. Here's a here's an example.

Lem Quimpo   1:11:02
Yeah, that's our webinar.
Video Explorer.

Peter Wolf   1:11:08
So let me, uh, I put this In the chat.
At the webinar sample.

Lem Quimpo   1:11:39
Sample links.

Peter Wolf   1:12:05
Yeah, so it's only simple I have right there. Well, I could try maybe.
So you see how these all list their specific thing? I don't know if that's tagged on it somewhere or In the metadata or something. See how yeah, video or blog or e-book or white paper or success story.

Lem Quimpo   1:12:18
Oh yeah, like the video.
Yeah, yeah, if.
I think, yeah, perplexity would be able to, yeah, get that one. Yeah, that's good. It it actually has A tag. So that's, yeah, that's really helpful thing.

Peter Wolf   1:12:35
I mean 'cause it.
This would be a lot better like each of those tags. If we said if we had blog or success story, I mean that would really be good In the parentheses after the title. And you know what then, Lem, that what what should happen though, what should happen to Lem is then we should put another column In the In the spreadsheet.

Lem Quimpo   1:12:48
Yeah, I'll I'll try that one like to get the tag.
Good. Thanks.

Peter Wolf   1:12:59
In the In the newsletter spreadsheet, we should put another column that says media type and it would be blog or video or success story or brochure, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:13:03
Yep.
Meet.
Yeah, the on the STS, right, STS.

Peter Wolf   1:13:18
Oh yeah, I I'm saying on the on the on the tab. I should have these on a shortcut, but I don't. Hold on here.
So here on our Google sheet for the filtered articles, this is actually article. It's now going to be articles, blogs, videos, right? It could be any of those that has a or no, this is internal. Sorry, this one here.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:00
Yeah, Esther. Oh, yeah, right.

Peter Wolf   1:14:00
STS blog post we should put. We should put a column In here that says um.
Source media or media type?

Lem Quimpo   1:14:09
Source media OK uh.

Peter Wolf   1:14:12
Right. Or let's let's put media. Let's put media type, media type and media type would be, for example, video or webinar, blog, uh, success story.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:23
Me.
Media type like uh then this would be on the.

Peter Wolf   1:14:28
Yep.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:33
Like like the tags, right? Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:14:36
Yeah, so this would be here's, here's example. So it'd be video, it'd be success story.
Brochure blog. Yeah, so because I I we're seeing it here when I come back to my website, we're seeing it on the website, but I'm not sure. Let's let's drill down to a couple of these and see what it.

Lem Quimpo   1:14:46
I am based based on searching that OK.
Mm.

Peter Wolf   1:15:02
I don't know where I just get where I go.
Yeah. So like if we drill into any one of our blogs, let's see. So here's success story.
SD log transfers Treasury operations. Huh. So this one is actually a link to the video.
Um.
Says success or so learn now.
I'm just surprised that's what's there because then we have other ones that are Estee Lauder.
So I mean, this is clear because it says bad author and that's clear that it's a blog, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:16:32
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:16:34
Bye.
See like this is success story. This has got multiple things here and uh.

Lem Quimpo   1:16:50
Oh.

Peter Wolf   1:16:53
I mean, I don't know if it's gonna be able to tell. I mean, I I think this is, this is that maybe we should just plug it In and see what it comes up with.

Lem Quimpo   1:17:02
Yeah if like it like it if it can't get the tag I what I can do is just like the blog or video or something like blog or webinar and then but if it's able to get the tag so that's much better I think because it's more like more specific but yeah I'll I'll.

Peter Wolf   1:17:21
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:17:22
Try it too. I'll try perplexity on on if it if it can tell like the tag or like I'll change the wordings also in.

Peter Wolf   1:17:33
Yeah, so so again, if I plug this right here right now and I trigger this, it will fill this in.

Bryan Wolf   1:17:42
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:17:43
The Yeah, that's right. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:17:48
Brian, did you figure out why we were having that thing running every 15 minutes?

Bryan Wolf   1:17:52
Yeah, we, uh, had changed the, uh, the trigger. Yeah, I did the.

Peter Wolf   1:18:00
Did we determine how how bad that is?

Lem Quimpo   1:18:02
Huh.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:02
It's fine. It's fine. Our account is fine.

Lem Quimpo   1:18:05
Yeah, yeah, it was the trigger. Uh, it it didn't copy the.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:10
We just so instead of losing our tokens our it was just overwhelmed and overloaded. So when we just ran this morning we had to use a lesser version of it like when it's like 3.5 old instead of like the new 4.0. So tomorrow or definitely by Monday we'll be able to switch that back to 4.0. It was just it was so over.

Lem Quimpo   1:18:17
Yeah, it's really limited.
Oh.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:30
On the it can't process the all the data.

Peter Wolf   1:18:32
Right. But we're only going to do it one time per day, right? One time per day, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:18:32
Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:18:36
Yeah, that's fun. Yes.

Lem Quimpo   1:18:37
Also, Peter, I I think this won't work because we added another column. Yeah, like the we could delete the first this column so that can I delete this? I'll just copy this on this side. Yep, yeah so.

Peter Wolf   1:18:43
Oh, OK.
Yeah, I got. But you you have captured that, right? You captured that. OK, so now I'll take this off.

Lem Quimpo   1:18:55
Yep. OK.

Peter Wolf   1:18:57
Hold on a second.

Lem Quimpo   1:18:59
Yeah, so because the hook was still on like column F, so that's it. It won't pick that up, but yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:19:04
Yep. OK, so now.

Lem Quimpo   1:19:14
Correct.
Yeah, so uh, is this the new one?

Peter Wolf   1:19:34
Yeah. So this was, this is what I just put in. So this is, let's see here, where is this Estee Lauder overhaul? It's fragmented Treasury operation and some of the non socialized business, but sometimes results are streamlined.

Lem Quimpo   1:19:36
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:19:52
Access real time cache visibility. Yeah. So I guess what we want to do is we want to see if it Can figure out whether it's a blog or a success story. I I don't know. Let me give you this. Let me give you this page too, right? Because this is the main.

Lem Quimpo   1:20:02
Yeah, that's right.
Yeah, then.

Peter Wolf   1:20:09
This is our main knowledge center that that you Can see what they're tagged as, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:20:14
Yep, the knowledge center. Uh, Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:20:16
Yeah, so then, uh, what am I here?
So if you Scroll down, you'll see that here's here. For example, here's Treasury brochure, right? I'm just gonna include this too. This gives you a couple different examples that are In the sheet.

Lem Quimpo   1:20:36
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:20:36
OK, so here.

Lem Quimpo   1:20:39
Knowledge center. Yeah, I also.

Peter Wolf   1:20:43
So I'm gonna put this. Hold on. Let's say this is this is supercharge efficient control. This is this was a video. No. Hold on.
I think this was tagged as success story, right? Success story. And then or that's not where I want it, right? I don't want it there. I want it.
Yeah.
Then this I wanna go here.
I think this is a webinar.
Uh.
You guys don't want to see my rental real estate financials. Um.

Bryan Wolf   1:21:27
No, no.

Peter Wolf   1:21:33
I keep forgetting I'm I'm going here, then I'm gonna go to the spreadsheet. It's not a spreadsheet. It's In In this here.
Right. Say yes on this and that is a webinar.

Lem Quimpo   1:21:45
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:21:53
All right. Oh, I put it In the wrong place.
OK, so that's a sexy success story.
To webinar and let's see what else we got. We got a.
Look what it says up here. Look In the title.

Lem Quimpo   1:22:35
Brochure. Uh, yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:22:36
I can't. It's like it's really foggy. No, it's just very.

Lem Quimpo   1:22:41
Yeah, that's for sure.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:22:50
Get it out of the title blog. It's right there for us.

Lem Quimpo   1:22:52
Yeah, I think, yeah, that's much better. It's ChatGPT will be able to parse that out. Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:22:58
Yeah, so just parse that right after the surround.com, parse it out, put that In parentheses right after. That's gonna be great. That would be that would look good. I think it also shows them that there's variety, right? There's variety In that. So if it said here, video blog, whatever, that's good, OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:23:02
Yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that's much better. Yeah. And that's very straightforward. Yep.
Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:23:18
Perfect. And yeah, so then we don't really. Well, you know what? Let's Let's still add the column. I'd like to be able to see In the column that it was the blog or whatever, right? So when Chachi BD parses it out, I still wanted to go. I want to include that into a new column.

Lem Quimpo   1:23:31
The.

Peter Wolf   1:23:38
column here, right? Source media.

Lem Quimpo   1:23:39
OK. Oh, yeah, yeah, we yeah, we we're gonna add it to a column. Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:23:44
Yep. But it'll come from the, it'll come from the URL, right? Directly after whatever surround.com. Perfect. I love it, right? So I I really think this looks great, guys. It's it is now down to me needing to get a couple banners, right? New banners that they're gonna accept.

Lem Quimpo   1:23:49
Yeah, the URL. Yep. Yep, that's right. OK.
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:23:56
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:24:00
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:01
Yeah, 3 banners.

Peter Wolf   1:24:02
Yeah, I got a call with the with the head of marketing on Monday and I'm going to show her this and I'm going to tell her, look, we've been working on this. We got to deliver this and I'm not sitting around wasting any More time. I need the banners and then I got to get the e-mail addresses and then I need that access that. So I need you to write up that.

Lem Quimpo   1:24:21
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:24:23
The technical aspect of what exactly I'm going to need, right, that I'm going to be requesting. Yeah. And and if you could, if there's any chance you could get that to me before Monday morning, my time, so that when I'm on the call with the chief marketing officer that I Can put that In front of her, OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:24:25
OK, yeah, on on Bravo.
Yep, that's right. OK.

Bryan Wolf   1:24:28
OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:24:40
The Bravo documentation, right. OK, yeah, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:24:42
Yeah, right. Whatever I'm going to be saying there. I mean, it shouldn't be that big deal. She's not a technical person, right? I just need to give her a basic overview of what I'm saying that we're going to have the newsletter from Bravo and and then.

Lem Quimpo   1:24:54
Yes.

Peter Wolf   1:24:58
Yeah, maybe, maybe In that you could do a ChatGPT summary of what Bravo is, right? Just extract and give me a summary of what Bravo does. She may be aware of it, I don't know. And then exactly what we're trying to do, OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:04
Yep. OK.
OK. Yeah, yeah, we could. I will give that to you. And then basically we could also use actually like other maybe you you guys already have like a platform for sending e-mail campaign because Bravo is just like a.
Uh, milk. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:25:28
They do. They do have one. It's Merceto, but I but but I don't. And maybe Merceto, maybe that's what they'll tell me to do is just use Merceto. But then that would mean we'd have to move this whole thing into the Microsoft environment too.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:31
OK.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:25:45
I think maybe not. Maybe. Yeah, I think I'd have to go into Microsoft environment.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:46
Oh, um, what? What's?
Mercado is the uh Microsoft uh.

Peter Wolf   1:25:53
No, I don't think it's Microsoft. No, I don't believe it's Microsoft. It's outside tools, so maybe I wouldn't have to go in the Microsoft environment.

Lem Quimpo   1:25:53
Oh yeah.
This is Marketo. Marketo. MARKETO. Is that it?

Peter Wolf   1:26:00
Yeah.
Yep, Yep. So that's a marketing newsletter or not newsletter. It's an e-mail campaign thing. So I don't know about doing the newsletter part, right? That's the Brevos is is doing the making it a newsletter or well, really we're fully, we're building it and then we're just delivering it there, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:26:06
OK.
Yeah, e-mail company.
Yeah.
No, uh.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, we're just delivering it. So the Brevo is just like delivery, just the delivery platform to like send a mass e-mail. So we could like use other ones like Mailchimp. So there are like a plenty of also like campaign.

Peter Wolf   1:26:34
OK, so it's just Bravo is just the mail, the mail, mass mail. But you were showing me that you went into Bravo and you were editing the format and I don't know that that would be In Mercado.

Lem Quimpo   1:26:40
Yeah.
Uh.
The yeah the HTML form, but basically they use most of the them when we send in send it via API so they would use like HTML code. So even for example on Gmail as you can see on Gmail loaded it there on the make.com so you would still we would still.
You don't need the HTML code, so that's like already like static. It won't change. So we would just be changing like the the platform if that makes sense. So most of them are using HTML when it comes to like e-mail campaigns, like sending e-mail for like the formatting and stuff.

Peter Wolf   1:27:23
OK. OK. All right. So I'll talk with her about that, but you Can at least put the Brevo thing together and then then, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:25
Yeah.
OK. Yeah, yeah, I'll, I'll, I'll also, yeah, I'll prepare that one. I also like supplement it with the loom video, maybe their developers like IT.

Peter Wolf   1:27:39
Yeah, I don't think she's gonna go. She's not gonna go that far in, right? I mean, she's Chief Marketing Officer. I'm just gonna give her the short version. OK, so then here's one other thing I'd like to do. I'd like to add a little bit of spacing between the bullets, right? It's a little too blurred together.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:42
Uh, OK, yeah, yeah, OK.
OK, Yep.
Oh, OK.

Peter Wolf   1:27:56
So if we.

Lem Quimpo   1:27:56
I think what because I've checked like I checked the like the I like the superhuman AI like they have or I think that's the rundown newsletter like AI newsletter they just they they put here like A5 word insight. So I've added here like one sentence insight but they actually.

Bryan Wolf   1:27:57
No.

Peter Wolf   1:28:07
Yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:28:15
We have like only 5 words here, so it's pretty like just very concise. Yeah, it's it's tighter, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:28:19
Tighter instead of. Yeah, I like that because the IT looks kind of sloppy with the wrapping, even with a couple extra words on the next line that looks a little sloppy. I think it's we should the the the prompt. Cardell should say it should be single line, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:28:25
Yeah, that's right, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, like it should be like, yeah, like 5 to 5 to less than 10 words or I don't know, but like 6 to 7 words, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:28:39
Yeah, they should definitively say it should not wrap into a next line, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:28:45
Yeah, yeah, basically like 5 words is and then I think for the rundown they use just the titles for the insights. So the title's only like 5-7 words. So they they that's the one they they put it in the today's their insights like the rundown bullet list.
So that's much cleaner. I was also saying that one compared to this one, this is actually like a long sentence. So it's the other Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:29:07
OK.
Yeah, yeah, it just looks sloppier, right? And everything else looks very tight. So I'd definitely go with single line, again, less than a line. But if you say let's try and make them consistent, like you said, it's like 5 to 10 words or less than 10 words or something like that.

Lem Quimpo   1:29:18
Yep.
Yep, Yep.
Yeah, I think that's, uh, yeah, much better.

Peter Wolf   1:29:26
Um, I'm trying to find where I got my superhuman. I'm trying to find my latest uh.
Hold on a second, P9.
There we go.
Right, so I also wanted to. I want to put my image or something, right? Again, I'm gonna.

Lem Quimpo   1:29:59
Uh, this is the Superhuman.

Peter Wolf   1:29:59
I want something that's gonna make that message from me, right?
So.

Lem Quimpo   1:30:10
Yeah, I think it's on the rundown AI. It's not. Yeah, it's not on the.

Peter Wolf   1:30:15
I actually think ours looks cleaner than this.

Bryan Wolf   1:30:18
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:30:19
Yeah.
It's much uh.
Yeah, there are like awkward spaces on there. Um, there are bullet lists something.

Peter Wolf   1:30:26
Yeah, I think ours looks cleaner than this.
I kind of like this that doing, you know, coming up with something that's kind of cute, right? Little cutesy thing, whatever, something a little sideline that maybe we can look at again in the future. Um.

Lem Quimpo   1:30:50
Friday phone.

Peter Wolf   1:30:55
Yeah, I like this too. What does ours say? Ours just says AI tools. Maybe we should have it here that says productivity. What does it say here?

Lem Quimpo   1:31:03
Yeah.
I think it was.

Peter Wolf   1:31:07
How'd we do productivity, AI tools and updates? I like that. Good.

Lem Quimpo   1:31:08
Yeah, Proactive. Yeah, Proactive, yeah.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:31:15
Yeah, this looks great. I'm I'm really impressed with this. I think this is freaking terrific. Yeah, now you you are doing a hell of a job, Len. This is, this is good stuff.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:18
You're welcome. Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:31:19
OK.
Thanks. Thanks. Yeah, you're welcome.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:22
I'm kidding. It's all Lem. It's all Lem. It's all Lem. Thanks, Lem.

Lem Quimpo   1:31:35
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:31:35
There, right? We really are there. I just got to get them sign off and give me the freaking banners and and emails and let US, run. Yeah, OK, So what else? What else we got? What's going on?

Lem Quimpo   1:31:36
Yep.

Bryan Wolf   1:31:39
Wanting more things?

Peter Wolf   1:31:51
We wanted to look at the other flows and figure out what what else we're going to now clean up, right? So you got a couple little cleanup tweaks on that. I Can tell you I found a developer and Len, I understand. I would have loved to have you kind of continue to move forward into that other environment, but.

Lem Quimpo   1:32:00
Yep.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:32:10
I think there's still potentially opportunity that will continue to build some flows and yeah, cuz I also have personal stuff that won't be inside that Microsoft environment. Some of the flows you already started for the Agentix with the integration with.

Lem Quimpo   1:32:20
OK, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:32:30
ChatGPT or a front end, you know, app, iPhone app, those I'll continue to develop and they'll be outside. So I'll definitely be continuing to work with you on this stuff, but we're probably going to be shrinking down on the number of hours.

Lem Quimpo   1:32:38
Oh, OK, Yep.
OK, no problem. Yep. OK.

Peter Wolf   1:32:45
As we move forward, right, right now, I would like to again just emphasize that for let's say for next week, we'll still be plowing forward cleaning up flows. But definitely given that we're not really building new flows, it really should be focused on documenting the flows, documenting the functions and processes.

Lem Quimpo   1:32:53
Yep.
OK, Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:33:05
If you have some Loom videos, if they're like outdated, maybe we update those because this would be really. Remember Lem, I'm doing this partly just so my my interns here Can really be learning from this and have take away stuff that they Can reference and use.

Lem Quimpo   1:33:11
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:33:22
To, you know, to be able to build their skill sets and be playing around. So the More the the More clarity In the documentation, the better off we are, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:33:22
Yeah.
Yep. OK. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:33:34
OK. So I greatly appreciate you focusing on that stuff.

Lem Quimpo   1:33:37
Yeah, I I also updated like the old flows like yeah like the triggers. So I've added the web hooks and then like use clod something there.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:44
Mhm, mhm, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:33:45
Yeah. And so we we definitely, we still need to proceed on walking through this because again, these flows now we need to go back through them, walk through them and bring them to fruition like the newsletter, I believe the newsletter right now, aside from just the banners.

Bryan Wolf   1:33:50
Definitely.

Lem Quimpo   1:33:50
Yeah, we need.
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:34:00
And these couple little tweaks, I think we're done right now. Again, we may do other cool stuff going forward, but I think we're done with this process flow right now. And and so I want to move on to taking the others. So we got the process flow for the LinkedIn posting.

Lem Quimpo   1:34:02
Yep.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:34:15
Right. And now that, you know, now that I think we've refined some of the kind of, I can't even remember because that's that's from the news article. It's the same set up as the news articles, right. But now that we have the perplexity, perplexity seems much better. So it might be that we just switch that one to straight perplexity, right, if I'm looking to write a.

Lem Quimpo   1:34:16
Yep, that's right.
2.
OK.
Yeah, perplexity is.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:34:35
blog, then I just do perplexity at the time I'm ready to do it and it says go find me the best articles over the past week and and then just on the fly right there, right? We just use that part because the inner reader clearly isn't as attractive as perplexity, especially if I'm just trying to find one article.
That I want to post on today In LinkedIn, right. So I think that's a matter of fact, let's just say that right now. You Can move forward on that. Let's change the LinkedIn one, the LinkedIn posting from article to be not In a reader feed, but a perplexity.

Lem Quimpo   1:34:56
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:35:12
Now, right now that's filling a spreadsheet, right? So I guess we'd have to be it would be a we'd need a a new hook or a trigger or would make just trigger that and we just do that. Well, Can we Can we pull that? Can we pull that one up and look at that that spreadsheet I got.

Lem Quimpo   1:35:15
Yeah, on a spreadsheet.

Peter Wolf   1:35:32
Here, I guess, right? Newsletter research dashboard.

Lem Quimpo   1:35:34
Yeah, the newsletter.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:34
I mean, I haven't. We haven't touched any of those old flows. I mean, like, I know, I know, everyone logging here.

Peter Wolf   1:35:38
I know, but that's so we gotta start somewhere, right? Yep. So company research, APA documentation.

Lem Quimpo   1:35:48
It's actually much better on, I think the spreadsheet, the Uh, yeah, the the one that is complete with all the links and.

Bryan Wolf   1:35:51
You've got a lot of repeats, I think.

Peter Wolf   1:35:53
Yeah, I'm looking for the spreadsheet, right?
Right, but so where? Where is? What's that one called?

Lem Quimpo   1:36:00
Uh.
It's uh Peter W process flow documentation on a Google sheet.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:02
I don't know. It might be in my. It might be in my all the earlier flows.

Peter Wolf   1:36:09
Peter P Peter PW Company Research PF3 Newsletter Newsletter Updraft Executable Collab Automation.
Yeah, PFW, my personal persona. I don't. I don't see it.

Lem Quimpo   1:36:26
I could send the link here on the chat. Uh, I'll just send the link here. Yeah, I think it's.

Peter Wolf   1:36:28
OK.
Funny that you have More clarity to where the junk is In my folders than I do. Yeah, OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:36:33
Um.
So there is uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:37
Me or him? Him. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:36:39
Oh, you were. OK, you were just going to this. I was looking for the original document. So the spreadsheet is In here. Good. OK, good. So I mean, I I forgot that you had it compiled here. So we go to LinkedIn, LinkedIn process flow and right here, right. So right now we have this as the.

Lem Quimpo   1:36:39
Uh.
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:43
Oh, no, no, no.

Lem Quimpo   1:36:44
Oh yeah, yeah.
Yeah, the spreadsheet also is in here.

Bryan Wolf   1:36:49
Yeah, this whole thing is, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:36:51
Yeah.
Yep, Yep, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:36:58
Is going out and populating and filling this In right?

Lem Quimpo   1:37:02
Yeah, that's right. Yep. On the chat. Yeah, that's yeah, this is auto populating and then it'll filter the next out. Yeah, the next one is already filtered like the top three coming from ChatGPT.

Peter Wolf   1:37:04
This, this, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:37:19
So the next sheet or the next tab and then.

Peter Wolf   1:37:19
Yeah.
I'm wondering now like if I think back to this the well, no, because now the the newsletter's only doing that summary. And so when we're looking at what's the intent or what's the relevance to our client base that was about doing that mini summary here we're having clawed and it is clawed we're going.

Lem Quimpo   1:37:38
Yeah.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:37:43
To her No, Chachi Biki. We want to make sure we're going to Claude. We want to go to Claude, OK?

Lem Quimpo   1:37:44
Yep, Yep, yeah, yeah, I already updated it to Claude, but I think it's much better to search research use perplexity because as you can see on the summary, yeah, on.

Peter Wolf   1:37:56
No, no, I agree. I'm saying for the written part, right? So we got perplexity, perplexity for the search, chat GBD for the filtering and Claude for the writing, right? OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:37:59
Uh, yeah, yeah, we would just got. Yep, that's right.
And.
Yep, Yep, that's right. Yeah, yeah. Cloud for the right thing.

Peter Wolf   1:38:11
OK, so this is summary LinkedIn posting angle, right? OK, this was this is like relevance, right? Similar to relevance we were doing LinkedIn posting angle. OK, all right. So then if if you've already updated those, then I'd say let's let's run this. No, let's add a perplex.

Lem Quimpo   1:38:19
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's like our relevance.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:19
Mhm.

Peter Wolf   1:38:31
Part right?

Lem Quimpo   1:38:32
Yeah, we need to add the perplexity part. Yeah, yeah, it's still picking up from either reader. Yep. And then we yeah, yeah. So it it will also like find 10 articles, right? 10 articles per day or?

Peter Wolf   1:38:34
Similar to what we have In the exactly, we'll let it keep picking up from inno reader. No reason to take that out, but let's just add perplexity.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:48
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:38:49
Yeah.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:49
Yeah, that's fine.

Lem Quimpo   1:38:50
OK, yeah, same with the.

Peter Wolf   1:38:50
Well, I don't, so.

Bryan Wolf   1:38:53
I'm not.

Peter Wolf   1:38:54
I mean, yeah, you know what? I'm thinking maybe the volumes or whatever would be smaller. I'm I'm wondering here on the perplexity. Look, this is really the way I'm expecting. This is kind of, it's More ad hoc saying.
You know, twice per week I want to write, I want to write A blog that's about an article that is, you know, that's that's out there and it's hot topic. We already got the Inno reader feed and again, we might as well just add the perplexity and we see perplexity is getting More content.

Lem Quimpo   1:39:21
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:39:30
But then we just get to choose from this anyway, right? So.

Lem Quimpo   1:39:31
Yep, yeah. And actually we could like if you want, we could use the if like it's the same articles that you want. So we could actually also.

Peter Wolf   1:39:43
We could just use the same ones from the from the other thing. We could just use the newsletter and put another column and say that that's just going to be for individual posting.

Lem Quimpo   1:39:47
Yeah, yeah, the newsletter.
Yeah, right. Or what my what my plan is, is to route the data to this particular spreadsheet so that we won't be creating like duplicate also costing extra operations. So what will happen is from the newsletter flow it will add also that data to this spreadsheet, the LinkedIn spreadsheet.

Peter Wolf   1:40:06
Right.
Yep.

Lem Quimpo   1:40:14
So we would have here like a title, URLs, a summary and also it has like a relevance I think or let me just.

Peter Wolf   1:40:22
Yeah, so all you're gonna do is take all the function that's In the newsletter to populate the tab for the newsletter articles, and you're gonna populate it here.

Lem Quimpo   1:40:25
4.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:40:31
Perfect. Then we're not paying for twice. We get the same set of artists. We don't have to manage it at different places. That that feed is just going to feed one for the individual blogs and one for the for the newsletter.

Lem Quimpo   1:40:35
Yep, that's right.
Yep.
For.
Yeah, that's right. Yep. Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:40:47
OK, I like that. I think that's great, right? And then this one will.

Lem Quimpo   1:40:50
Oh.
Yep. And then, yeah, so it would be like from inner reader. I'll just add another column here so that we would have, we can see like if it's coming from inner reader and also if it's coming from from perplexity. Yep. So that we could also have that one.

Peter Wolf   1:41:02
Yep, Yep.
Yep, perfect.
OK, so then remind me then after it comes back, then log tracker, this is where we where we trigger. I'm trying to, I'm trying to remember what the hell how we managed this, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:41:22
Yeah, that's like 3 topics on Ino reader. So they have like different websites that's supposed to be the plan like yeah, the AI finance impact and then the other one is finance transformation. So that's the that's why there's like a check mark there. Then it would route to that particular folder or like.

Peter Wolf   1:41:31
Brain.

Lem Quimpo   1:41:42
Uh, like a list of websites.

Peter Wolf   1:41:42
But does this make sense? Does this make sense still? And if you were using the other one to populate this, would this be irrelevant? Like the part? I forgot this. We like this right? This was a different person could be picking A to trigger their their.

Lem Quimpo   1:41:46
Uh.
Yeah, I think, yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:41:59
Well, I thought this was to trigger that they wanted to be the ones that were writing the article. It was gonna go to their individual LinkedIn or something like that. But now I'm looking at this is here. How does it know which article they picked?

Lem Quimpo   1:42:08
Yeah, that's right.
It's it's on the blog tracker actually, but I I can actually yeah this one. So it would have like the team member name there. So like the team member would be the name of the one who.

Peter Wolf   1:42:26
Right. But remind me, so here. OK, so let's say now we have this. The the newsletter feed is feeding this, right? Now here's here's a problem that I'm thinking about is like I I want this to be available for Nick and for Brian and for Peter.

Lem Quimpo   1:42:35
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:42:45
And if we're using the newsletter feed, for me, that's efficient because I'm I have it all In my account. I'm paying for all this stuff, right? But if they were to put this into their account, then then having those big, those separate flows doesn't make sense, right? They would what? They'd have to capture a portion of the newsletter.

Lem Quimpo   1:42:52
OK.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:43:04
Flow. Put that together with the LinkedIn flow and make a singular flow together that they could use, right?
Meaning if they were doing this In their account, if they were doing this In their account.

Lem Quimpo   1:43:12
Yeah, like a different.
Yep. Oh, if they're doing this in their account, uh, yeah, they will need to like.

Peter Wolf   1:43:21
Yeah, like I'm not gonna be supporting Nick to be able to use my account for him writing his blog post, but I want him to be able to to use this In the future, right?

Bryan Wolf   1:43:27
No, no, no, no, no.

Lem Quimpo   1:43:27
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. But this one has actually like for like different users because that's like the first like system that, yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:43:38
Right. Yeah. OK. But so remind me here if.
If I'm triggering today, let's say Brian and I both want to do something today. How does this work? Like this right here seems it's only about one of the articles we're grabbing or something, right? This is just pulling In the articles.

Lem Quimpo   1:43:44
Oh.
OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:43:59
Trigger the automation to pull In the articles or remind me what this process flow is. I'm confused on what's going on here.

Lem Quimpo   1:44:02
Yeah, that's right.
So first is when you click that one so it would the trigger automation so it would get the articles for that particular like folder.

Peter Wolf   1:44:18
So it's not being fed on a regular basis. This is say, OK, I want to pull articles on this, OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:44:20
Yeah, it's not. No, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:21
No.

Lem Quimpo   1:44:23
Yeah, yeah, it's not being fed every day, so it will just process it if it's it's already triggered like the trigger at automation and then it will get all the like the new ones, the new because the feed is always updating, right? So.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:41
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:44:42
By that time when you click the trigger automation, it should trigger and then it will get all of the all of the news feeds and then put it on all articles. So it's not daily populating daily.

Peter Wolf   1:44:51
OK.
OK, but so that now it populates. Now it's In here, right? But it's not associated with one person's name here, right? It's just right. OK.

Lem Quimpo   1:44:55
Yeah, it now populates and then the.

Bryan Wolf   1:44:56
Mm.

Lem Quimpo   1:45:00
Yeah, not yet, not yet. Yep. So what will happen is it will go to the ChatGPT filtered and this one will be already has the like the team members you can see there. So this is like the the top three, top three like.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:01
No, no.

Peter Wolf   1:45:07
Yep.

Lem Quimpo   1:45:18
That, uh, top articles that it.

Peter Wolf   1:45:20
OK, so so if I triggered this here, if today I just triggered this, it would go update this with articles and then then it would it would then deliver them to ChatGPT. Isn't this after it already delivered it to ChatGPT?

Lem Quimpo   1:45:25
Yep.
Yeah, that's right.
Go.
Yeah, that's right.

Bryan Wolf   1:45:38
Well, it'll send. It sends a good.

Lem Quimpo   1:45:39
No, actually I already like because I also like suggested to like remove the articles. But you said also that time that no, maybe we could use that as reference. So I've added this like all articles but basically yeah this would be like.

Peter Wolf   1:45:48
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:45:58
All of the articles that is being like from IN reader and then the other one is the from the ChatGPT filtered. So that's why it's ChatGPT filtered and then it already has the LinkedIn post angle and then the summary and then the URL and then.
Next is when we go to the blog tracker.
Yeah, so that one is, uh, it will auto populate the.
The Google Doc link here.
Um, let me just go, I think.

Peter Wolf   1:46:30
So OK, so this is already this is already been chosen and created and then here I'll be able to see. I really am confused on this. I gotta be honest with you, I really am confused.

Lem Quimpo   1:46:34
Uh.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:38
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:46:41
Yeah, yeah, let me let me just open the.

Bryan Wolf   1:46:42
Wow.

Lem Quimpo   1:46:48
Um, let me just open the LinkedIn once.
So be there. Yeah, this one.
So it's much more, uh, easier to see it on the.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:05
Make.
This is the only one I don't have set up for your account too. I just have it for my personal one, but I'll put it on there after this.

Peter Wolf   1:47:22
OK, yeah, we need to set it up In my account.

Lem Quimpo   1:47:23
Uh.
Uh.

Peter Wolf   1:47:28
But we should probably wait because it looks like we may be going to do some revisions to this.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:31
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:47:33
Yeah, um, yeah. Can a uh.
Yeah, can you share share my screen for. So yeah, so what's happening is yeah, these three routes, so it would trigger for for 1st and then it would go to the route wherein.

Bryan Wolf   1:47:42
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   1:47:54
It's like the topic and then it will start for duplicate and then it will put first here as you can see all articles in the database and then it will aggregate it all and then feed it to ChatGPT and then iterate it and then put it again in the all articles Chat GP filter. So this is already.
Here on the chat PT filtered and then it just closed the loop and then trigger the next automation. So this is continually this would continue here on the next.
Yeah, next content system. Yeah, the LinkedIn #2.
And then?
Status not yet done. Oh yeah, right. I the flow here is different because I've created it as webhook. I think we need to update this one to have the.
Choosing on the other ones. Let me just check the link in process flow.
Yes, so trigger automation. It will go here and then it will go here.
Then yeah, so I think what we need, I need to.
Update this one to have a column here to choose the article.

Peter Wolf   1:49:29
Yeah, because right now there's no selection, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:49:30
Here on that.
Yeah, there's no selection, so it's just choosing the one that is already not not done. Let me just check if.
Yeah, that's right. Yep. So we need a selection criteria here on on. Yeah, here on the ChatGPT filtered and then.
Yeah, basically we need a selection here and then you could already see the like who, who's the team member who like triggered it. And then we have also like the day, like the day search. Yeah, so.
The one that's lacking here is a.

Peter Wolf   1:50:13
Just hold on, let me. I'm just, I'm wondering if this is if we just over engineered this right now at the time it made a lot of sense. I was thinking OK, I want to, I want to post on different types of articles. I don't want to just post on a single theme of an article.
But now we're talking about, well, we're we're using perplexity and and we already have it, you know, we already have a function that's running for the newsletter. But I kind of like these two things being separate, right. And and what I'm starting to think now is if we had.

Lem Quimpo   1:50:44
The.

Peter Wolf   1:50:48
If we use perplexity and go back to the to the first tab, right? So the triggers, we've got three different topics. If we use perplexity and each of those topics right there had a slightly different blurb.

Lem Quimpo   1:50:54
OK.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:51:05
For this or prompt then and we only use perplexity. We didn't bother with Inno reader anymore, right? We Can use Inno reader on the newsletter. But here if we said OK, these columns Can be different prompts and and that we use perplexity and based on.

Lem Quimpo   1:51:11
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:51:23
Whichever column that I choose, it will take the prompt that goes with that and says, OK, I want one that's focused on technology or I want one that's focused on AI and finance, or I want one, right? But then it would call.

Lem Quimpo   1:51:28
Yep.
Yep. Yeah, I get. I see what you. Yep. Then it will. It will put it here, right on the other. Yep, then.
Yep, yeah, Yep, that's right.
Yep, that's right.

Peter Wolf   1:51:46
And the person's name says, well, we could have here. We'd have like, OK, I just ran it and I put a bunch of articles In there. I choose one article. I put my name In and I say I want to post on this article and it would still leave all the other articles out there. Someone else could come In that same day and say, OK, yeah.
Like that article and they put their name next to it and they post on the other article.

Lem Quimpo   1:52:08
Yep. Yeah, I think, uh, that's, uh, Yep, that would be much better.

Peter Wolf   1:52:13
Right, so so let's let's just let's say this. We're gonna cut out the inno reader from this. We're going to input the perplexity. We're gonna have perplexity have a choice of multiple prompts. Those prompts are triggered by the first column. Which prompt is used?

Lem Quimpo   1:52:17
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:52:32
Right. And so each prompt would be focused on. Yeah, each prompt would be focused on that title. So when the prompt says go find me the most of viral articles over the last seven days or five days or two days or whatever on this particular topic. And so there'll be slightly different prompts.

Lem Quimpo   1:52:33
OK.
Yeah, for this one, Yep.
Yeah, OK.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:52:52
I don't think the Team member part or I guess maybe the why would we need the Team member here really, right? Would we?

Lem Quimpo   1:53:02
Um, yeah, we could just put it on the.

Peter Wolf   1:53:07
Yeah, so here on the first one would just be, hey, I want to go trigger some articles. So it doesn't matter who's doing it, I just want to trigger some articles. And so we come In here and we click one of those. We have the date, right? We click the articles and it updates based on that date. No name there.

Lem Quimpo   1:53:12
Yeah, Yep.
OK.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   1:53:25
It fills In the next no name needed there. I don't think it's just the trigger, right? Then it it automatically fills In the articles tab with the with let's say the top top five articles from whatever that topic is.

Lem Quimpo   1:53:25
Yeah, no name here.
OK.
Yep.
Yeah, this one.
OK.

Peter Wolf   1:53:41
Right. And then and then we select here, someone puts their name In selects and then they say, Yep, I want to, I want to write the article and it sends it to Claude and then it pushes forward the rest of the way, right. But I guess you still need a filter. You need the.

Lem Quimpo   1:53:42
OK, Yep.
Yep, so.

Peter Wolf   1:53:59
ChatGPT filter to take what perplexity finds and then filter it out, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:54:04
For like basically it would.

Peter Wolf   1:54:06
If if perplexity is, go ahead.

Lem Quimpo   1:54:10
Basically, uh, what will happen is it will feed here like the five articles.

Peter Wolf   1:54:15
But the five articles were chosen by Perplexity or by ChatGPT, right? Because right now, when we go to Perplexity and we run that, aren't we running the output from Perplexity through ChatGPT to figure out the best ones?

Lem Quimpo   1:54:16
But.

Peter Wolf   1:54:29
Or no? Are we just taking them directly from perplexity?

Lem Quimpo   1:54:30
No, not. Yeah, from perplexity on the newsletter flow. So it's just from perplexity. It's all going through the newsletter, like the spreadsheet and.

Peter Wolf   1:54:41
And again, what are we we're using? We're using the prompt and A and a target market or what are we using to to for the perplexity selection criteria? What are we using again?

Lem Quimpo   1:54:53
Uh, we we don't have. It's just uh on the prompt, so.
On the let me go here on the so on the newsletter newsletter flow perplexity on the the like the new the number 9 so the new one so this is the.
Oh.
As you can see here, so perplexity and then format to Jason and then it's just formatting and then getting the image and then then Claude will create the content. So there's no step here that is.

Peter Wolf   1:55:18
Yeah.
So we don't do selection. We just told Plex to find me the five best articles or what?

Lem Quimpo   1:55:30
Yeah.
1010 articles and yeah, 10 articles. And then Claude creates the content for every 10. So basically every day we have ten articles, but we also have the duplication here, so it won't process if it's already a duplicate like.

Peter Wolf   1:55:35
10.
OK, but so just to make sure, so we're saying find the 10 best articles, it's happening daily and then it goes to Claude and then it it Claude writes that little blurb or something. Is that what it was?

Lem Quimpo   1:55:54
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. Yeah. Yep, it it it writes it on the.

Peter Wolf   1:56:06
It writes the rationale or what was that? What was it writing?

Lem Quimpo   1:56:10
The this blurb the news the the same with the coming the ones that are coming from Inu reader. So it's already creating the like the blurb, the new section blurb. So Claude is the one that is doing that one.

Peter Wolf   1:56:24
Because perplexity doesn't give you the blurb.

Lem Quimpo   1:56:28
Yeah, that perplexity is just giving the summary and the relevance. That's why we have it summary here and the relevance. And then this news subsection final content is coming from to.

Peter Wolf   1:56:36
OK, but but that final content is really the newsletter output, and that wouldn't be relevant. That wouldn't be relevant for the single posting, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:56:42
Yes, that's right. Yeah.
Sing.

Peter Wolf   1:56:49
For single LinkedIn posting, that blurb that's going In the newsletter, that wouldn't be relevant. We're going to write a whole blog.

Lem Quimpo   1:56:59
Yeah. All right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   1:57:01
So what we would really want is we'd want to trigger. Yeah, go ahead.

Lem Quimpo   1:57:04
I know.
This is the the coming from. Yeah, but the summary is just short. I think maybe we could. Yeah, I think we need to because we added on the prompt here to just add like short 50 word summary and then 100 word for the.
I think 50 word also for relevance.

Peter Wolf   1:57:25
Yeah, but so so think about this. In the newsletter, that column H is the output we're gonna we're gonna use In the newsletter, right? That's the actual output, right? OK, so In the LinkedIn post, we don't need that.

Lem Quimpo   1:57:33
Yes, that's right.
Yes, that's right. Yep.
Yeah, we don't. Yeah, yeah, we don't.

Peter Wolf   1:57:41
We don't need column H. What we want is column F&G because from F&GI Can look at it and say, Oh well, great, this is kind of relevance and this is this is the way I could see Claude kind of writing it, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:57:52
OK, here.
Yeah, yeah, that's right. So yeah, that my plan was actually to oh, you mean from here, right? Yeah, OK, we can just put that particular prompt the same as on the we could copy actually that prompt and then change, just change the search for this one and then this one.
And then basically it would add, it would add here.

Peter Wolf   1:58:17
Right, right, right. So, so a prompt is slightly different for each of those titles. Then it comes back, it gives US, perplexity, gives US, the ten articles or whatever it is, and it gives us, Yep, summary and relevance.

Lem Quimpo   1:58:24
Yep.
Yep, the same as this summer relevance.
Yep, Yep, here.

Peter Wolf   1:58:33
And then from from that I pick one, I put my name there and then I say, Yep, I want to write an article on this and it sends it to Claude and it says it creates everything, but it knows it's for me, my persona, right? Because that Team member is the persona thing too, right?

Lem Quimpo   1:58:37
Yeah, you pick one.
OK.
Yeah.
Yes, that's right. So we have a switch module for that. This one is already auto populating so it's coming from. Oh we we won't be needing I think this one basically what what we will add here is because this name is actually already.
On here. So what I will do is we will remove this.

Peter Wolf   1:59:12
No, no, hold on. Because go back to the first one here. The where originally we had name In there, we took it out because it doesn't matter who goes to trigger to get the articles, right? We don't need the name there.

Lem Quimpo   1:59:17
Yeah, we we, yeah.
Yeah, OK, yeah yeah. I think the name will be with matter here, just here. So I will add here for example this one. So I will add drop down with the names. So for example, so this will be the one that will update.

Peter Wolf   1:59:37
Yeah.
No.

Lem Quimpo   1:59:42
The that will update the persona. So now we yeah, it's coming from here, not on the yeah. So basically here we will be needing this one. So I will remove this one so we can just choose the articles here and then just click.

Peter Wolf   1:59:46
Yeah.
OK.

Lem Quimpo   2:00:02
Yes. And then we can have like the status.

Peter Wolf   2:00:03
But see, here's the part I don't understand is why wouldn't you have the name here? Because if I'm the one who's selecting this article.
I'm selecting this article.

Lem Quimpo   2:00:12
Oh, OK. Yeah, yeah. I think that would. Yeah, yeah.

Peter Wolf   2:00:15
You know what I mean? If I go here and I select the article, I'm identifying I'm the one doing this. So at that point that's where the the the tying the person and the article together should be.

Lem Quimpo   2:00:20
Yes, that's right. Yep.
Yep, I think, yeah, that's right. It should be here. And then this one would auto populate that team member. Yep.

Peter Wolf   2:00:32
Right, right, right. Exactly.

Lem Quimpo   2:00:35
Yep. So that we would know who who is the one who like, yeah, who who asked for it? That's right. Yep. Yep.

Peter Wolf   2:00:40
Who asked for it, right? And then that person Can come over here. They see their name over there and they click on the row that they had and they see they they go In and they Can edit the document, right? Cause that's the Google Doc link. They Can edit the document and then they say, Yep, it's good and they send it on.

Lem Quimpo   2:00:46
And then ready to push. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, I think that's, yeah, that's much leaner way to. So we would go from, let me just delete this one. We would go from here, so trigger automation, so search perplexity will search for the newest articles. So it's triggered manually, not every day and then it would.

Peter Wolf   2:01:06
Sure.
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   2:01:18
Populate here and then the the user could just choose and then if you already chose. So first what I would need to do here is first put the name because if we check this, if we check this and then there's no name.

Peter Wolf   2:01:19
Right.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep, Yep, Yep, got it. You're right first and we'll and we'll make it clear, right? You have to. Let's just why don't you put a function In there that says In Order to click H there has to be a value In G.

Lem Quimpo   2:01:37
Uh, there would. Yeah. So yeah.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   2:01:48
Put a validation, right?

Lem Quimpo   2:01:49
Yeah, like a validation. Yeah, like a formula, right? Just like a formula here.

Peter Wolf   2:01:50
Right.
Yeah, that says it it to in order to check this box, there has to be something in G.

Lem Quimpo   2:01:57
OK. Yeah. And then.

Peter Wolf   2:01:58
That way you know you can never trigger it without a person's name on it.

Lem Quimpo   2:02:02
Yeah, that's right. And then yeah, so we have the team member and then whenever he checks that it will the document will be here. So this will auto populate and then there would be like the name here for example.

Peter Wolf   2:02:14
Yep.

Lem Quimpo   2:02:18
On who added that one, then, yeah. And then if it's already good, like we check the document and then it's already good. So now we could ready to post and click that one. Yeah, I think that's much, yeah, much cleaner. So yeah, this got, yeah, we got confused here because we changed this like.

Peter Wolf   2:02:32
Perfect.
Yeah, I understand. Again, we've been moving along and changing our understanding as we've moved along. So things have changed. I don't have a problem with that. So let's modify this and clean that up. That'll be the next one that we want to bring to full fruition, so.

Lem Quimpo   2:02:38
Tweaked it several times. Yeah. So yeah, yeah, that's right.
Yep. OK. Yeah.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   2:02:52
That we can, uh, yeah, finalize on that, start using it.

Lem Quimpo   2:02:55
Yeah, I think this, this, this one much, yeah, will be much easier because I will just copy the like the cloud prompts like the perplexity ones. Yeah. So this must be this is relevance, right? Yeah, relevance.

Peter Wolf   2:03:01
Yep.
Yep, Yep.
Perfect.
All right. So let's go with that, what we have right now. So you got a couple little tweaks in newsletter, you're gonna update this flow and update documentation and then, yeah, and then we'll we'll be good. And then give me that little blurb or summary or overview about the Brevo stuff that I can give to the CMO.

Lem Quimpo   2:03:13
OK.
Yeah, the Revo. Yep, I'll, I'll, yeah, I'll also prioritize that one so that you could give that one to them, OK.

Peter Wolf   2:03:34
OK, awesome. And it does not have to be really that deep. Seriously, just like a a few bullet points in the in a chat CPD summary of what Bravo is. And I can just say to her, maybe we do this in Marketo or whatever, but this is what I need, right? And then the the technical part.

Lem Quimpo   2:03:49
Oh I I I won't need to be like doing like putting the like the tutorial for the like the webs.

Peter Wolf   2:03:57
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I only need.

Lem Quimpo   2:04:00
Um.

Peter Wolf   2:04:02
Hold on, maybe we're talking past each other for this little thing I only need. I just need a little write up. It started with I need you need the technical access to be able to approve for Bravo to write from my domain. That's what I want to ask for right now. So give me a little bit of a write up.

Lem Quimpo   2:04:15
Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

Peter Wolf   2:04:22
That says what I need to ask my IT for to be able to do that, right? To prove that it's our domain. That's what I'm gonna ask for to start with. Now if they push back and they say no, we'll use Marketo, I'll say, OK, well, then tell me how we go about doing that. But right now I've got it set up to link into Bravo and I really want it to come from.

Lem Quimpo   2:04:26
OK.
Yeah.

Peter Wolf   2:04:42
Our domain and that's what I'm going to push for.

Lem Quimpo   2:04:44
Oh OK, so the the documentation that I will create is just a like a write up right of the how to.

Peter Wolf   2:04:50
I'm talking not even you're calling documentation. I'm calling it like a like an e-mail, you know, like 5 bullet points and a little summary that says what I'm trying to achieve.

Lem Quimpo   2:04:54
Like, just a right. Yep. Yeah, I I was, I was thinking like to create also like photos, like click this and then where? OK, yeah, yeah, just just.

Peter Wolf   2:05:03
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I just want to be able to speak clearly when I'm talking to her and say currently we're using Bravo. That's our, that's our e-mail campaign newsletter function. And I know we have Marketo inside, but I want to be able to trigger this newsletter. Do we put this?

Lem Quimpo   2:05:11
OK. Yeah. Yeah. OK.
Yep.

Peter Wolf   2:05:23
This into Mercado and if so, can you do some research though on integrating APIs to Mercado?

Lem Quimpo   2:05:29
Yeah, I can yeah check if they have like API endpoint access for.
Yeah, if we could do that one, that's uh.
Yeah, they're they don't have on make natively, but if they have like API endpoint access publicly, so could also connect. I think I'll yeah, I'll also look at that one Mercato.
Mercato Campaign. e-mail campaign. E-mail campaign. OK, Mercato Campaign.

Peter Wolf   2:06:08
Yeah.

Lem Quimpo   2:06:14
Yeah.
right up
Intro.
OK, so it's it's just like, uh, like a like a yeah, like a bullet list for like a guide for uh.
A rough guide. OK, Yep.

Peter Wolf   2:06:37
Yeah, again and and really your guide is even sounding too big. I just want some bullet points, right? Just like think of an e-mail. If I was sending an e-mail saying, hey, we're using Brevo, we use this for the for the e-mail campaign. We put in our newsletter into that campaign and it tracks the statistics of who clicked on what and all the different.

Lem Quimpo   2:06:42
Yep.
Yeah, too.

Peter Wolf   2:06:56
You know, aspects that they can control, right? And that we want to.

Bryan Wolf   2:06:59
*** **** it, Lem.

Lem Quimpo   2:07:00
Yep.

Peter Wolf   2:07:02
Shut up, Brian. And and and and that that you want to, we want to be able to authorize using our domain e-mail address. That's what we're looking for, right? That's what I'm asking for. Something short, tight like that, like I was putting it into a text message or an e-mail. Nothing more than that.

Lem Quimpo   2:07:03
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right. Yep.
OK. Yeah, got it. Yeah, I got it.

Bryan Wolf   2:07:22
Short and tight like you, Lem.

Peter Wolf   2:07:24
Yeah.
Alright, so we're good. We're good.

Lem Quimpo   2:07:29
OK. Yeah, very good.

Peter Wolf   2:07:30
Thank you, Lem. I appreciate it. Great job. I'm really pleased again with where we're at and I'm looking forward to getting the rest of these kind of finalized and cleaned up. I feel like we have a lot more, at least for me. I mean, I have a lot more understanding a little.

Lem Quimpo   2:07:35
OK. Thanks.

Peter Wolf   2:07:45
More clarity. And as we've morphed through these, I think that's really what's taking the time is the different kind of iterations. Oh, let's include that, let's change that. But that's what it takes, right, to come up with a good flow and ultimately you're rethinking it, looking at the complexity and trying to figure out what's going to be efficient and what's going to produce the best output. So I'm.

Lem Quimpo   2:07:54
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.

Peter Wolf   2:08:05
Very pleased with what we got. OK. All right. Talk to you guys. See you.

Bryan Wolf   2:08:07
Awesome. Awesome.

Lem Quimpo   2:08:08
OK, Yep.

Bryan Wolf   2:08:11
All right, talk to you Monday, Lam. I'll miss you this weekend.

Peter Wolf   2:08:15
Goodbye.
