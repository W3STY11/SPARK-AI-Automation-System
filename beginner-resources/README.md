## 📋 **What Actually Exists (Real Data)**

### **📊 Documentation Spreadsheet**
*From July 18, 2025 meeting - Lem created this to track all flows*

> **Lem**: *"Yeah, I I also created a spreadsheet so that we could easily like track all of the flows with the. So yeah."*

**Status**: ✅ Created by development team  
**Purpose**: Track all 5 automation flows with documentation  
**Location**: Referenced in meeting transcripts  
**Next Steps**: [TO BE ADDED - Need access to actual spreadsheet]

## 💡 **"Prompt of the Day" Section**
*Peter's specific requirement from July 17, 2025 meeting*

### **Peter's Exact Vision**:
> *"There's another component I want to put in here that is a **prompt of the week or prompt of the day**... in the finance treasury space, the issue is companies don't want to put their proprietary information into a non protect[ed] tool..."*

### **Specific Example Peter Gave**:
```
CURRENCY ANALYSIS PROMPT (Peter's actual example):
"You've got exposures and these are your three primary exposure currencies. 
And tell me what's happening with these currency pairs over the last six months 
and give me some information. News of what would have driven that right to go 
out to the local... Central bank for whatever currency and country and give me 
some information on that, right? So it's generic."
```

### **How It Works** (From Peter's explanation):
1. "We'd go come up with what's the next 5 prompts of the day"
2. "We go work with ChatGPT, get the prompt of the day" 
3. "We go back to the spreadsheet"
4. "We put the prompt title, we put the prompt"
5. "You select the button and say include in the newsletter"
6. "That prompt too if you go click on it in the newsletter. It takes you to a editable version"
7. "You can just copy it and paste it right into your... ChatGPT"

**Status**: 🚧 Conceptual framework defined by Peter  
**Next Steps**: [TO BE BUILT - Need to create the actual prompt collection system]
